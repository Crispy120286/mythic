### Summary
The First Life. 

Sketchy reports have begun circulating in scholarly circles of runes in the silver sky of the Astral Plane. Some claim these signs warn of the return of some being from the first age, and their stories are now given more credence than ridicule. Scholars have partially deciphered the runes that summarize it's history. Most claim they herald the return of Ragnorra. **(Planes or Religion DC 32)**

It is said that [[Rovagug]] was created when Pharasma thought she could perceive something gnawing in the dark place between the stars. It is undecided if that fear became [[Rovagug]] or was the fear in the first place. The first living being was created not long after when Pharasma used the seal and that being was Ragnorra. Little more then a tumor made of positive energy the Quasi-Diety was tasked with seeding life across the Universe. Ragnorra performed it's task well, seeding life both horrific and beautiful across the newborn worlds. **(Planes or Religion DC 37)**

Ragnorra performed it's task well, seeding life both horrific and beautiful across the newborn worlds. When it's task was complete Ragnorra was left by the Pantheons to it's own will. The Pantheons began to shape those worlds and life by their own whims. Upon being let loose Ragnorra began to revisit the seeded worlds and "fixed" the mistakes of the Dieties, turning the God-Changed life into reflections of her. The Gods thus angered cast Ragnorra to the furthest reaches of the spaces beyond the planes and went about repairing the Corruption of Ragnorra. **(Planes or Religion DC 42)**

A vocal minority of planar scholars claim the runes tell not one tale, but many. Each rune has been written atop a previous one, incorporating the earlier rune in its form. The runes’ gigantic size suggests that the story of Ragnorra has been told many times, rewritten each time she is to appear. Each of the prior tales ends in the extinguishing of mortal races on a world and the corruption of all its life. **(Planes or Religion DC 47)**

Moving through spaces between planes, Ragnorra appears about once every 1,500 years on the Material Plane. Her arrival takes the form of a fiery Pink-green comet. The astral runes are not a warning so much as a “signpost” that points out Ragnorra’s path to the next world. **(Planes or Religion DC 52).**
