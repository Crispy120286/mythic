### Summary
The First Life. 

Sketchy reports have begun circulating in scholarly circles of runes in the silver sky of the Astral Plane. Some claim these signs warn of the return of some being from the first age, and their stories are now given more credence than ridicule. Scholars have partially deciphered the runes that summarize it's history. Most claim they herald the return of Ragnorra. **(Planes or Religion DC 32)**

It is said that [[Rovagug]] was created when Pharasma thought she could perceive something gnawing in the dark place between the stars. It is undecided if that fear became [[Rovagug]] or was the fear in the first place. The first living being was created not long after when Pharasma used the seal and that being was Ragnorra. Little more then a tumor made of positive energy the Quasi-Diety was tasked with seeding life across the Universe. Ragnorra performed it's task well, seeding life both horrific and beautiful across the newborn worlds. **(Planes or Religion DC 37)**

Ragnorra performed it's task well, seeding life both horrific and beautiful across the newborn worlds. When it's task was complete Ragnorra was left by the Pantheons to it's own will. The Pantheons began to shape those worlds and life by their own whims. Upon being let loose Ragnorra began to revisit the seeded worlds and "fixed" the mistakes of the Dieties, turning the God-Changed life into reflections of her. The Gods thus angered cast Ragnorra to the furthest reaches of the spaces beyond the planes and went about repairing the Corruption of Ragnorra. **(Planes or Religion DC 42)**

A vocal minority of planar scholars claim the runes tell not one tale, but many. Each rune has been written atop a previous one, incorporating the earlier rune in its form. The runes’ gigantic size suggests that the story of Ragnorra has been told many times, rewritten each time she is to appear. Each of the prior tales ends in the extinguishing of mortal races on a world and the corruption of all its life. **(Planes or Religion DC 47)**

Moving through spaces between planes, Ragnorra appears about once every 1,500 years on the Material Plane. Her arrival takes the form of a fiery Pink-green comet. The astral runes are not a warning so much as a “signpost” that points out Ragnorra’s path to the next world. **(Planes or Religion DC 52).**

# Sign: Twisted Life

##### LV 1 Faint: 
Positive energy effects become more potent and negative energy effects are diminished. Once barren islands begin to recover their natural growth in the form of wild edibles and native plantlife.

- All Islands gain the "Vegetation: Wild" trait and all farms double production. This leads to a crash in the BP output of farms, setting it to 2BP per 1MP in line with the regular output for a production building/hex. On the plus side nobody is starving.  
    
- Positive Energy Effects are at +1 Caster Level, Spells with the Healing descriptor are cast at +2 Caster Level. Channel Positive Energy effects are evoked at +2 Class Level. Negative Energy, Inflict Spells, and Channel Negative effects are at a opposite penalty.  
    
- Gestation times and growth times to maturity are reduced by 25%.

##### LV 2 Moderate: 
Living beings in the comet's glow. are hardier, faster, stronger, faster to mature, and can thrive in even the harsh enviorments of the Shattered Golarion.

- All unsettled Hexes become farm hexes and no longer require much effort to maintain. Farms automatically produce 1bp a week and do not require manpower.  
    
- All living beings gain a +2 Sacred Bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.  
    
- All physical aging penalties are reduced by one step.  
    
- Gestation times and growth times to maturity are reduced by 50%.  
    
- Living beings require half as much Food and Water to survive.  
    
- All living beings gain regeneration 1. Any Healing above their normal max HP will be converted into temporary HP up to their effective Constitution score. If somehow a being gets a healing effect that results in them being healed for their total HP (plus any temporary Hit Points) they explode into a burst of positive energy that heals all creatures within 30ft for 10d6 + the exploding creatures constitution modifier. This can cause a chain reaction.  
    
- All physical aging penalties are reduced by one step.

##### LV 3 Strong:
Growth goes out of control. The elderly and infirmed regain the vigor of youth. The living can no longer die by natural means.

- All Non farm hexes require 1 MP a week to prevent them from becoming farm Hexes. Farm Hexes are now more hostile then beneficial. Traveling through a farm hex requires a Survival or Knowledge:Nature Check DC 25 or become trapped in the twisted growth. (Evard's black Tentacles, CMB +26, CMD 36, 1d6+4 DMG a round)  
    
- Gestation times and growth times to maturity are reduced by 75%.  
    
- All living beings gain regeneration 5. Any Healing above their normal max HP will be converted into temporary HP up to half their effective maximum HP. If a being gets a healing effect that results in them being healed for their total HP (plus any temporary Hit Points) they explode into a burst of positive energy that heals all creatures within 30ft for 20d6 + the exploding creatures constitution score. This can cause a chain reaction.  
    
- All physical aging penalties are reduced by two steps.  
    
- Creatures only require food and drink once a week. Creatures do not die at 0 hp.

##### LV 4 Overwhelming:

- You have yet to experience it.
