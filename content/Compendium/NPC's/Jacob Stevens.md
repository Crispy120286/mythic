# [[Jacob Stevens]]

### Summary
A stern even tempered man. He has high expectations of those around him, under him, and of himself. A fit build under the tattered leathers of the island. He's a generalist sorcerer whose focus is less on arcane might or research and more on staying alive, winning the fight, and accomplishing your goals. He is the one that takes the sheltered members of higher castes and lets them know how dangerous the world is, taking as extreme a measure he needs to. He has slicked back sandy brown hair and a goatee. Plain brown eyes and generic facial features.

Kind of an asshole but means well. Taught Caeris how to best survive in this harsh environment that is his future.
