# Journal
## Neth 14, 2348. Week 64. Spicy fart Island
We're back on our ship.

[[Irthicax Vane]] hinted that every island had one of his friends on it.
This [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] insisted he was the only one.

We make plans for the upcoming days.

## Neth 15, 2348. Week 64. Spicy fart Island
Back to the island!
This time I stay on the skiff. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] pulls it.
We get to the volcano. I elect to stay in the skiff some more, I definitely cannot climb.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] steers the ship up the volcano.

- We see the Argus. It throws obsidian boulder at us. shit! 
- I cast Mythic Haste.
- The Argus throws another obsidian boulder at us.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] begins singing.

[[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]]- "We come in peace and mean  you no harm."
Argus- "That's good, stay out of the crater." As it speaks we feel the quaking through the volcano, see the ripples in the lava. the obsidian cracks.
Caeris- "You have a sign to the being known as [[Ragnorra]]."
Argus- "I have been assigned as guardian."

The runes in the silver sky of the astral plane- [[Ragnorra]] doesn't create the sign, she follows them.

Caeris- "What are you guarding it from? or for?"
Argus- "From people who would follow it."
Caeris- "Why do you want to keep people from following it?"
Argus- "Because that is my charge."
Caeris- "Who charged you with that."
Argus- "Elysium"
Caeris- "May I ask your thoughts on [[Ragnorra]]?"
Argus- "A painful subject. I resisted the natives of Elysium. Lost my path. They charged me with guarding one of her silver runes. and so I did, and so I do, until the thing is ended."
Caeris- "What would you say if we could help you with that."
Argus- "You're a liar or a fool"
Caeris- "A fool may be, but we are not a liar."
Argus- "I don't throw in with fools. Thought I am one myself."
Caeris- "Why do you call yourself a fool?"
Argus- "I am a twice fool. I resisted Elysium and was twisted into this form. Second i tried to resist [[Ragnorra]]. The sign has changed. overlapping and twisting."
Caeris- " Anything we can do to prove our intent"
Argus- "none have so far"
Caeris- "We have been charged in power."
Argus- "you are not the first, and not the last."

The Argus sounds very defeatist. As if confronting [[Ragnorra]] is not worth it and she will just take over anyways. Same with [[Rovagug]]. 

[[Aurora]]- "Are you trying to tell us something without telling us directly?"
Argus- *Doesn't respond in any meaningful way*
Caeris- "Are you Geas"
Argus- "No"
Caeris- "Can you let us see the sign?"
Argus- "I can not"
Caeris- "Is there something we can do in the interim?"
Argus- "We can fight and I can go back to the darkness"
Victor- "What do you think of [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] [[Irthicax Vane|Vane]]?"

Argus- "The leader of the malice shapers? [[Ragnorra]] can make as many of him as she needs, [[Ragnorra]] can make as many of me as she needs. [[Ragnorra]] created life. [[Ragnorra]] can not be stopped. Anticipate fighting yourself in the future."

Caeris- "We must fight, We can not let it happen."
Argus- "Show me."

We have the power to resist [[Ragnorra]]'s power. 

We show him how we can resist by spending Mythic Power.

Argus- "Very well, I must guard the sign." He walks into the volcano.

How do we follow? well crap.

[[Aurora]] and I fly to investigate the volcano.
We  go down the side. Get splashed by some Lava.

We see a silvery thing in the distance. Silvery multi-layered sign that somehow still appears two dimensional. Looking at it makes my head spin and my stomach queasy.

I cast Arcane Sight and Read Magic.

Knowledge Arcane, Planes, Geography.
This is the sign, I'm going to attempt to decipher it.

I should have gone insane. this is the literal stuff of madness. the sign of an eldritch of horror is in front of me, but I guarded myself with Mythic Power. My book still holds true. "You are you."

Arcane 54 = 44 + 6 + 4 
Planes 53
Geography 50 = 48 + 2

Transcribing the arcane. The planes is for rough positioning, the route she took through the astral plane. Literal dots on the larger piece of the sign. Geography to pilot to the next sign. 

[[Aurora]] grabs me quickly and flies off. A massive hand reaches up and [[Aurora]] turns back and grabs something from its hand. Its head peeks up and speaks. 

"Hope. Remember Hope."

We get back to the Skiff.

The Argus gave us a ring. I detect magic, It isn't magical. Hmm. Glittering crystal band. Its substance seems unearthly. Honestly I have no idea what it is. [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] also has no idea.

We go back to the warships. I set the course and then immediately take a nap.
