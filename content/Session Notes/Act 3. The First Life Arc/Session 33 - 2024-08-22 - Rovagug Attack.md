# Journal
## Neth 3, 2348. Week 64.
The battle continues.
- I cast Mythic Haste on [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]], [[Voltaire]], [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], and Myself. Plus 4 mooks.
- I cast spectral hand.
- I cast Fly on [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]].
- I cast gracelessness on the green dragon.

[[Rovagug]] destroyed my float stone!! bastard. Everyone manages to save my crew and the supplies from my ship.

I take command of one of [[Voltaire]]'s ships.

## Neth 9, 2348. Week 64.
We continue sailing and see a massive wall of fog.

We have encountered a system called Skyvale.

We all split up and begin searching for islands.

## Neth 11, 2348. Week 64.
We find an island. a 1 mile tropical jungle.
We land a dingy with [[Aurora]]. 
We begin to explore. we see smoke below us. civilization? we go down to is. I cast fly on myself. So many goblins! they're so drunk.

Purple man. [[Irthicax Vane]]. Despite my invisibility, he seemed to have noticed me. He speaks highly of [[Ragnorra]]. He has a mantis that he flies on.

We leave. who the hell was that.
