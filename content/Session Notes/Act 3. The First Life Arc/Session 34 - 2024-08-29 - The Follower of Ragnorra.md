# Journal
## Neth 11, 2348. Week 64.
We met with the purple man, [[Irthicax Vane]]. He loves the perfection of [[Ragnorra]].
We cut some wood for supplies.
there are plenty of goblins on the island. they're kind of stupid.

We're back on the ships and are having a meeting.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]], [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], and [[Aurora]] heads down to the island, I stay up and repair my equipment.

[[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] is a Zenythri. A strange race. As Aasimar are touched by the celesital planes, Zenythri are touched by the plane of Order. He has sworn off material posessions. He is unafflicted by the ravages of time. He is a follower of the Dao. Need to tell [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]].

I head backdown to the Island. I meet with the others and we converse with [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]].

He tells me about his world, it also had flying islands. 

As I mention [[Rovagug]] destroying my ship he gets angry.

He says [[Ragnorra]] is PERFECT. and she brings her perfection.

I ask for a definition of perfect. he says I would have to see it. 

[[Ragnorra]] is in the system and there a runes and signs that can bring us to Rangorra. Follow the path that she has travelled will lead us to her.

The thing that I pick up on is that he is unaware of his age, or is underestimating it. He says he heard [[Rovagug]] was imprisoned and heard he became Semi-free. He could be many thousands of years old.

When did you come to Golarion? I ask. 

By the rise and fall of our sun. 8 weeks ago.

He says is not alone. He says there is one for each Island in the system and the rest are with [[Ragnorra]].

The others and the battle slaves are loading up the trees onto skiffs.

[[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] asks a lot of questions.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says we're cautious because of Stranger Danger.

We all leave and head up. He offers to help me get started following [[Ragnorra]]. I politely decline.

We went with 30 helpers but returned with 29. One fell into the latrine and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] refused to take him back up.

> Hindsight, I should ask him about the worlds broken magic.

Maybe [[Rovagug]] is only semi broke free.

The tub can clean extra? it magically heats the water. I'll have to use it tomorrow.

A little but later [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] tries to talk to his patron but he fails, he is taken over. He wants to go down to the Island. [[Voltaire]] goes with.

Not too long later we hear an explosion and the trees violently start shaking.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], [[Victor Kasune|Victor]], and I head on down.

We see [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] having a ninja fight in the forest. When did [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] learn how to do that? Oooh, It is his Patron who is still in his body. He's fighting with his old skills.

[[Voltaire]] is watching and shaking his head. He isn't sure who is winning. This is impressive.

[[Voltaire]] says his patron is a Minotaur. Interesting.

[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] became himself and lost the fight. He's healed with potions.

He asks if he can come up to our ship. [[Voltaire]] says "Why not?" So we invite him up to the ships.

We go back to the ships, [[Voltaire]] minions have bags of monster crystals.

> [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Voltaire]] talk with [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]]. 
He says his companions are on the nearby islands. The goblins named them, the closest island is... Spicy Fart, an active volcano.
The island we're currently on is Boozer.


## Neth 12, 2348. Week 64. Boozer Island.
[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] seems to have recovered. [[Aurora]] wants to leave as quickly as possible.
 We should split up. [[Aurora]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]], [[Voltaire]] and myself, [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]].

We head out to find a... Spicy Fart.

That night [[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] uses the magic tub. It does have cleaning properties but the effects are already diminishing. Where the tub came from was warded. Soon the cleaning effects will disappear.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] found it first on the second day.

## Neth 14, 2348. Week 64. Spicy fart Island
We find Spicy Fart. We can smell the sulfur and see the magma and fireballs. This island is made up of many volcanos.

[[Aurora]] gave us each Protection from Fire.
One blocks 10 Fire for 50 Minutes,
The other blocks 20 Fire for 70 Minutes.

A volcanic island in constant eruption with obsidian spikes. We see glowing orange boiling ocean waves. 

We are here to find the Sign for [[Ragnorra]]. I guess its going to be a point of Green Life somewhere on here.

OBSIDIAN HURTS!

We finally get to the base of a volcano.

The volcano begins to move, Magma Elementals begin to surround us.

Then from the black obsidian tentacled creatures appear as well.
