# Journal
## Neth 16, 2348.
The next island is called Piss Water. Damn goblin naming conventions.
I show the navigator the map I drew and we plot a course.
We're probably going to see another [[Irthicax Vane]]
[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] suggests we make a script.

The Argus says that every Island has an [[Irthicax Vane]] but there is only one [[Irthicax Vane]]. Odd thing to say.

[[Aurora]] thinks that [[Ragnorra]] has a prime [[Irthicax Vane]] Vane and these are all facsimiles.

Can [[Ragnorra]] mimic Mythic Power? I sure hope not.

We think [[Voltaire]] should tell the next [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] that we're there to kill [[Ragnorra]] to see what he will do.

I send a Sending to [[Lysander Ravensong|Lysander]].
Jacob is still working on the Lifeward spell. His a snag but should be ready within the week. No strides on the [[Ragnorra]] research. Probably should go the extraplanar binding route and barter for information. Will get names from [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]]'s Lillend Azata companions.

We're thinking of it wrong. Need to treat it as an Artifact. Pharasma created [[Ragnorra]]. So she would have a way to destroy it. We need to find the special way.

[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] goes to ask [[Aurora]] to ask her patron about religion.

Can we all go into a single mind space to speak to another patron? I ask the Archmage to ask permission.

No one succeeded in talking to their patron.

## Neth 17, 2348.
We convene again and try to speak with our patrons again. We succeed and Auroras patron is willing to speak with us. Majority Rules.

[[Aurora]] "We're ready father."

We are transported to what appears to be an area on a pleasant spring day. There's a white church and high bell tower. Large stained glass windows. There's one window that has a broken face. Judging by the other features, it looks like Aroden. We follow [[Aurora]].

Everything began in the age of creation.
Pharasma was the sole survivor of a previous apocalypse. There was a universe before this one? interesting. 

[[Ragnorra]] is split? Part of a whole, but distance does not matter.

[[Ragnorra]] has been stopped before?

I ask how and by who?

The priest says I would need to be asked by [[Irthicax Vane]].

[[Ragnorra]] doesn't create copies, she creates life.

How can we defeat [[Ragnorra]] or can you point us in the right direction?

The priest recommends we speak to Varzak. a psychopomp. Pharasma's Usher.

He wants us to remember all requests of the gods comes with a price to be paid.

We all leave. I neglect to say "Thank you father" and am punished in hell by getting dunked into the river Stix for a year and a day. He's an asshole. 

**WTF?!**

I am very traumatized coming back into the real world. [[Aurora]] is surprisingly empathetic.
[[Voltaire]], was also punished, He is screaming uncontrollably.

[[Aurora]] gives me a pill when I go to sleep. I had the best sleep I have ever had.

## Neth 18, 2348.
[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] calls everyone to his ship for a meeting. [[Voltaire]] doesn't join.

[[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] to [[Aurora]]- "I don't know what that was you gave me but it was amazing"
It was a mimic of a poison called the black mercy.

The Archmage wants me to write in my book. I do so. I spend the day to write in my book.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] finds out his patron was the last gnome on Golarion.

## Neth 19, 2348.
We arrive at Piss Water Island.

The scouts say there is one man on this island.

We meet a venerable tanned man. Hands calloused, skin tough. He's fishing.

I am able to speak to him with crudely translation. He says the other one is a monster, devil, demon, unholy creature.
[[Irthicax Vane]]. Convinced his people to travel to [[Ragnorra]]. 

The Sign is in the water. The coral has a path. 

He wants to be called Old Man. He will follow us now.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] scout, The coral is a labyrinth.
