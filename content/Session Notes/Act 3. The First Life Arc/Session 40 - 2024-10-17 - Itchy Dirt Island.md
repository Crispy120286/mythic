# Journal
## Neth 22, 2348. Itchy Dirt Island.
We arrive. 
I meditate and converse with the Archmage. I ask him about the domain. He shares that All of the mythic domains are connected. He says that Victors patron was once named Saerin. Dimitri ([[Luke]]) was also a part of them. A sort of 7th Mythic. He was something that the Archmage didn't understand.

I begin writing in the book. He tells me that anything I write into the book is truth to me. He suggests i only write truths in it. He recommends i write my spellbook into it as well.

I begin by starting with my Cantrips and moving on from there. When I get back I am exhausted. I must have been out for a while...

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]], and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] go scouting. They find an obsidian Pyramid. [[Voltaire]] wants to harvest the obsidian from it.
They come back and hold a meeting.

The island is inhabited and probably has a local deity. Auroras darkwood ship is beginning to sprout. Hobgoblin settlement. [[Voltaire]] doesn't recommend violence.

We need to locate the sign. Probably in the basement of the Pyramid. The guardian is a female cat thing. 

>[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] wants to have a strength games tournament. I tell about home and the Olympics and how it has contests for the best of every field. I tell about how I was training to be a Spell Duelist.

[[Voltaire]] suggests we start with the town.

## Neth 23, 2348. Itchy Dirt Island.

We bring tributes down and speak to the hobgoblins. they speak Egyptian. we don't understand them.

Wait a second, I do understand!

A captain approaches. Captain Merhu. They say that because of the turbulent times they cannot receive guests.

[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] is very pretty.

Captain Merhu returns. He has consulted with the oracle and will see un in Sekhmet's Temple. We enter the village. 

Me meet the Oracle. She offers us bowls of a pomegranate liquor.

She tells us we were preceded by [[Irthicax Vane]]. She says he went into the Pyramid. She assumed he is no match for the Local Deity within.

She wants us to enter with an offering of pomegranate and petition Sekhmet on their behalf, we can also petition our case to her ourselves.

We go to rest at the travelers lodge. We are fed. Pomegranates and fresh baked bread!

[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] and I go and gather information. 

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] go to find a bar. BEER!!

[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] talks about people and their culture. He speaks with the people and I write it all down.

The Obelisk. It cleans the water from the oasis. It does it because Sekhmet wills it to be so.

The papyrus scrolls are brittle and woven.

[[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] and [[Mythoros]] copy both scrolls.

[[Voltaire]] meets me at the Traveler's Lodge.

We go get beer!

## Neth 24, 2348. Itchy Dirt Island.

The first rays of the sun reach Sekhmet's Rest. Sekhmet's cleric comes in and brings in a clay urn. This will be the offering we bring to the guardian.

We all take part in a bloodletting ritual. The urn is filled with Pomegranate beer.
