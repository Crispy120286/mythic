# Journal
## Neth 24, 2348. Itchy Dirt Island.

We fight the Living Rune! [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] kills the adamantine golem. 

Next island is Poopool.

I collect the corpse of the Living Rune on the obsidian shards.

Jacob completed the life ward ritual, but hit a snag on the life bubble. dug into my coffers a bit, can send life ward.

That night [[Voltaire]] calls a Mythic Meeting. Sekhmet's Egyptian warship rises to join our fleet.

Kharima comes as Sekhmet's representative. She says she can cast calling and speak with pharasmas follower for that.

Glittering crystal band wider than normal ring. Seems otherworldly. Its made of a slightly squishy material. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] puts the ring on first. He feels "safer".

Used to be an elemental weird. bound to the ring some time ago. Guardian elementals usually bound to a place, this one is bound to an object.  

It responds only to [[Victor Kasune|Victor]]. He is a practitioner of the martial arts.

[[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] Vane lost his way. he left to barter with [[Ragnorra]]. 

**It is an minor artifact ring.**
