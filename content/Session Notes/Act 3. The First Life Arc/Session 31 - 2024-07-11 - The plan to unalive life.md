# Journal
## Week 57
A pink green star appears in the night sky, I have a bad feeling about this.
Positive energy effects become more potent and negative energy effects are diminished. Once barren islands begin to recover their natural growth in the form of wild edibles and native plant life.

## Week 58
Living beings in the comet's glow. are hardier, faster, stronger, faster to mature, and can thrive in even the harsh environments of the Shattered Golarion.

Food is very plentiful.
Rodent and vermin populations are exploding.
Healing magic is going haywire.

I roll Knowledge **Planes 37. **

Sketchy reports have begun circulating in scholarly circles of runes in the silver sky of the Astral Plane. Some claim these signs warn of the return of some being from the first age, and their stories are now given more credence than ridicule. Scholars have partially deciphered the runes that summarize it's history. Most claim they herald the return of [[Ragnorra]]. **(Planes or Religion DC 32)**

It is said that [[Rovagug]] was created when Pharasma thought she could perceive something gnawing in the dark place between the stars. It is undecided if that fear became [[Rovagug]] or was the fear in the first place. The first living being was created not long after when Pharasma used the seal and that being was [[Ragnorra]]. Little more then a tumor made of positive energy the Quasi-Diety was tasked with seeding life across the Universe. [[Ragnorra]] performed it's task well, seeding life both horrific and beautiful across the newborn worlds. **(Planes or Religion DC 37)**


I get in contact with all of the other Mythics.

Strange rumors going around about particularly powerful healing magic.

We should meet in Machina.

[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] says he was kicked out by the Hell-knights. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] "Oh?!" Everyone is excited to kick in some Hell-Knight teeth.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] goes to [[New Haven]]. It still looks like normal.

## Week 59
The comet makes two orbits. Growth goes out of control. The elderly and infirmed regain the vigor of youth. The living can no longer die by natural means.

The Archmage invites me to his study.  He serves me tea. It tastes exactly like the old empire tea.

He wants me to make a binder here. Anything I wrote in it will be stores here.

In the cases of other worldly events and apocalyptic scenarios, It is possible to shield yourself against its effects. Need to be twice as strong before I can shied an island.

## Week 60
[[Ragnorra|The First Life]] descends to [[Rovagug]]. The battle wages on for a week and a half. [[Ragnorra]] flees or is flung from [[Rovagug]]. The extra growth ends. Life returns to normal... for now?

## Lamashan 8, 2348. Week 61
The overgrowth comes back again. I have a REALLY bad feeling about this.
We all decide to meet on Machina. We all land in Crystal Cove. We see [[Ryland]]. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] arrives in one warship. [[Aurora]] arrives with 3 warships. [[Voltaire]] arrives with 4 steel covered Warships. 

I roll Knowledge **Planes 60** with assistance and mythic from the others.

[[Ragnorra]] performed it's task well, seeding life both horrific and beautiful across the newborn worlds. When it's task was complete [[Ragnorra]] was left by the Pantheons to it's own will. The Pantheons began to shape those worlds and life by their own whims. Upon being let loose [[Ragnorra]] began to revisit the seeded worlds and "fixed" the mistakes of the Dieties, turning the God-Changed life into reflections of her. The Gods thus angered cast [[Ragnorra]] to the furthest reaches of the spaces beyond the planes and went about repairing the Corruption of [[Ragnorra]]. **(Planes or Religion DC 42)**

A vocal minority of planar scholars claim the runes tell not one tale, but many. Each rune has been written atop a previous one, incorporating the earlier rune in its form. The runes’ gigantic size suggests that the story of [[Ragnorra]] has been told many times, rewritten each time she is to appear. Each of the prior tales ends in the extinguishing of mortal races on a world and the corruption of all its life. **(Planes or Religion DC 47)**

Moving through spaces between planes, [[Ragnorra]] appears about once every 1,500 years on the Material Plane. Her arrival takes the form of a fiery Pink-green comet. The astral runes are not a warning so much as a “signpost” that points out [[Ragnorra]]’s path to the next world. **(Planes or Religion DC 52).**

What do we do? We are all at a loss.

**Geography 39**. I try and get a idea of where [[Ragnorra]] went. I get a good idea of where she landed. We can start sailing into that direction.

To get between systems we need to sail over the void with nothing but [[Rovagug]] beneath us. 

It takes us 2 days to get to [[New Haven]].

## Lamashan 10, 2348. Week 61
[[New Haven]].
Wow the halfling whales can rise up quickly. They make a defensive formation. I go to [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the College]] to speak with Jacob if he is there. 

I am stopped by two guards. I meet with Dean [[Jacob Stevens]]. I give him the notes about [[Ragnorra]]. He needs to speak with his professor of Enchantment. His adorned with runic charms and is wearing armor. He wields a cold iron Warhammer. His name is [[Garrick Ironflame]].  I hand Garrick the information of [[Ragnorra|the First Life]] and explain what is going on.

> [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] purchase 3 Warships. I get one and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] gets two of them. 
> It costs me 8 BP.

Garrick gives me a ring. Jacob offers me a thought, Its pure positive energy. What happens if we cast Antilife shell. It wont be enough. Its probably too powerful but its a start. 

Someone rewriting the runes. It implies someone is rewriting them. A cult? Followers? 

An opposite working of Death Ward. A ritual spell? They will help with research and send some people to my Island. I give Jacob the location.

We hash out the plan for creating a ritual spell for a Life Ward spell.

### Counts Estate
We all meet up at the Counts Estate.

[[Voltaire]] is sad he couldn't mess with the Halflings.
[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] met his fellow musicians and sending the home.
[[Aurora]] says [[The Grove Maiden]] is giving us food for the journey.
[[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] tells them that the Wizards are going to try and create a ritual to Ward Life.

Dinner is steak and potato's! Lots of butter!
