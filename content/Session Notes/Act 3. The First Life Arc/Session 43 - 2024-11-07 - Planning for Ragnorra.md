# Journal
## Neth 24, 2348. Itchy Dirt Island.

**Tomorrows goals**:

- [x] Summon Phychopomp.
- [x] Speak with dead to Living Rune. Can we rewrite runes?
- [x] Talk to Jacob and get Lifeward.
- [x] Brainstorm ways to defeat Ragnorra.

#### Archmage. Rewriting a mutiplanar rune?
I already know one plane. The Astral Plane.

Does she have Free Will?

Is she creating [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] Vanes?

What are the Malshapers?

I was always rushed reading the signs. 

I can summon the sign in the Archmages domain and study it at leasure.

For now I sip tea and relax, writing in my journal.

> The Gnome tells [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] that they blew up the mood. The Archmage has an orbital defense system the size of a city. [[Rovagug]] spit a worm that infected the moon and it was looking at them.

## Neth 25, 2348. Flying to Poopool.

I cast a sending to Jacob. He is going to send the spell tablet to me. Teleport? He had to dig into my coffers.

#### Archmage's Study.

I go back to the Archmage. Different space. Plain grey  workspace. used to prevent blasts from destorying it from the inside. I dont see any doors or entrances. I do recognise the stones and size. Its a perfect geometric symmetry. Inscribed on the floor and ceiling are several binding circles.

I ask if i can bring forth my Familiar. he says not at this time.

I ask how to summon the sign, he says to will it. (INT + Mythic Rank. DC 20)

I summon the sign.

What planes do the signs connect to? The signs are multiplanar. They link to three planes.
- Prime Material Plane
- Astral Plane
- Positive Energy Plane

The signs never stop directing her. Whoever is creating these signs. Was pointing her to Golarion. Previous signs were separated by Light Years. The recent signs are much simpler, but no less intricate.

I don't know why someone would make the signs to close together.

### Mythic Meeting
I tell what I found from the signs.

The mantis is the Spelljammer!

Aboleths dont make scrags, they make scum.  Aboleths are the first types of life in the universe. Their memory is multigenerational.

Everything that was left behind at the sign was pumped up. they were extra powerful. It was some king of unnatural life. 

Karima is going to speak with dead on the Living Rune. We get 7 questions:

- **Who are you?**
	- I am the sign of Ragnorra.
- **What is your purpose?**
	- To point the way.
- **What do you know of Irthicax Vane?**
	- The blindingly brave being that challenged a goddess.
- **Why did you attack us?**
	- You attempted to read me.
- **Who created you?**
	- I do not know who drew me.
- **Why did you choose to stay in the tomb instead of exploring your surroundings?**
	- It was where I was born.
- **Do you need us to do anything on your behalf?**
	- No.

The sign was probably just a basic sign before it was spontaneously given life by Ragnorra passing.

We begin to gathering the resources to summon the Phychopomp.

Karima casts Planar Ally.

A tiny little Nosoi appears. A messenger. a Bureaucrat Birdy.

We have questions about the one who would prevent the cycle of reincarnation. Ragnorra, the being that prevents death. The Nosoi caws.

Anubus knows of the struggles.

We with for the name of an agent we could ask further questions of.
	I will find you one who knows of this and will return shortly.

a couple minutes later the Nosoi lands. IT knows of a being that would speak with us. It gives a name "---"
It will require no offering, This being has an interest in reincarnation.

Karima begins to cast Planar Ally, but suddenly starts casting Greater Planar Ally. Then something bigger. Ritual Magic...

An agent of Pharasma has taken over Karima.  I burn a point of Mythic power and assist her in the ritual magic.

The Stuart of Skein appears before us. One of the beings responsible of the cycle of death and the movement of souls. 

> Ragnorra's tie to the material plane is tethered by her sign, if her sign guides her from Gollarion, she will leave the planet.
> 
> Ragnorra's power is drawn from the positive energy plane, if that tie can be severed then Ragnorra will begin to decay and can be slain, her soul judged fairly by the Lady of Graves.
> 
> The Rough Beast did injure Ragnora, divine poison can further weaken her and draw the gaze of the Rough beast who will look to wipe out all trace of Ragnorra from existence.

I get a sending from Jacob.
He uses greater teleport to arrive to us, He has the Life Ward spell.
