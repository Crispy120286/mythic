## Neth 19, 2348. Piss Water Island.
We decide to wait until night to see the sign.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] harvest coral. One of his workers get cut, blue lines run up his veins. he gets stuff and rigid and his skin is pale. Another tourniquets the wound and saves his life.

The coral is very dangerous... and poisonous.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] brings it to [[Aurora]] to study. The coral is poisonous.

Its nightfall. We go back to the island.

We see bioluminescent strands going into an alcove underwater. We see where the glowing sign is.

## Neth 20, 2348. Piss Water Island.
We wait until the following evening.

[[Aurora]] gives me a Water Breathing Potion and a Touch of the sea potion.

I cast Ride the Waves on me and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]].

We begin to swim thru the coral.

I get hit with a wave and caught against the coral. [[Aurora]] cures the poison.

We're ambushed by a bunch of aquatic monsters.

We defeat them and move onward.

We move on thru the bioluminescent snot

I get hit with the coral again.

We find where we needed to go. An underwater cave.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] peeks his head up. there are some creatures in there.

When I surface I begin to suffocate. I cannot breath the air. oh no...
