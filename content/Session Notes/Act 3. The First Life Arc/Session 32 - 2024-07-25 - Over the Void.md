##### Housekeeping
- [ ] You said that 10sq miles is 1 hex on an island. Also that if an island is 1-15sq miles, its 1 hex, that means 16-20 is only 2 hexes?. How do we find one with 3 hexes or more?
- [ ] When sending allies off to recruit. How can we modify the number? It is just 10d10?

# Journal
## Lamashan 10, 2348. Week 61
I was given a ring of protection +1.

It will take roughly a month to arrive to our destination.

I take the middle of the formation. I'm told this is the bullseye. shit

## Lamashan 18, 2348. Week 62
It takes a week and a half to get out of the system.

## Lamashan 22, 2348. Week 63. The Void Sirens.
Sirens music plays around us. People are ready to jump ship.

I lose half of my crew. One of [[Voltaire]]'s ships goes down. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] loses a quarter of his crew. This day sucked.

## Lamashan 23, 2348. Week 63.
The Archmage looks older by a few decades. His mindspace looks smaller.
He says he is using his own power to strengthen us. He pulls a cloth off a pedistal and there is a small crystal orb.

>"Win, that is my only command" Says the Archmage.
>"I will" I say with conviction.

I am now Mythic Rank 3. As I leave the Mindspace I hear the  old man coughing.

## Lamashan 25, 2348. Week 63.
Things slowly return to normalcy. 

Suddenly I am overcome with the memories of the worst moment of my life. I remember the day I last saw my family. I was about to duel Kian when [[Rovagug]] attacked. 

Its a stray god. We attack it and it flies off.

We all call a meeting and meet on [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]]'s ship. That was the second stray god we seen in 2 weeks. They might be running from [[Ragnorra|the First Life]].

One of [[Voltaire]]'s captains, who is a Wolf Beast Folk, can smell a wreck down wind of us. They might be heading to [[Ragnorra]] there as well. And [[Rovagug]] wont send weaklings and they will be dangerous.

The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Use the wreck. Bait it, or send it towards [[Ragnorra]]. [[Aurora]] thinks we'll have to fight on two fronts.

[[Voltaire]] says that the next time we meet a stray god to catch and interrogate it.

## Lamashan 31, 2348. Week 64.
The crew seems to think the worst is behind us... and then the rain starts. Its a thunder storm. Scouts determine that the storm is too big to go around.

[[Voltaire]] orders his ships to pull down their sails. We all do the same.

## Neth 1, 2348. Week 64.
The storm begins to worsen. The wind begins to howl. Its an unnatural scream. The ships begin to rock.

## Neth 3, 2348. Week 64.
And then we escape the worst of the winds. [[Voltaire]] leads us out and towards where [[Ragnorra]] should be.

[[ROVAGUG]] IS WATCHING US!

* He spews up monsters to attack us. Dragons, Wyverns, and Kobolds.
* The red dragon lands on the deck of my ship.
* I cast Haste on my crew.
* [[Voltaire]] jumps to my ship and engages the Red Dragon.
* I cast Greater Invisibility on myself.
* My crew attacks and kills some of the kobolds with ballista.
* The Red Dragon breaths fire on my ship and crew. I respond with an Emergency Force Sphere. Many of my crew are dead and my ship is damaged.
