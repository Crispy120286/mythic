# Journal
## Neth 25, 2348. Flying to Poopool.

The meeting continues.

[[Jacob Stevens|Jacob]] brings a stone slate with the Life Ward Spell upon it.

We could Raise Dead the Living Rune, change it, and send [[Ragnorra]] into Space with it. We'll need to find coordinates. I could always use a previous point.

I get [[Jacob Stevens|Jacob]] a hammock and let him use Voltaires tub.

I go to speak with the Archmage.

#### Archmage's Study

To rewrite the sign, We would need to place it within space-time. Material, Astral, and Positive.

We used Mythic Severing on the Hivemind. This will require a significant amount of power and all 6 of us channeling. 

Mythic powers vary from mythic to mythic. Some are action based. Mythics like us are more precise. We would attack the problem like a surgeon with a scalpel. I should channel my power through a spell. 

I summon the ritual and show the Archmage.

He gives me a book, It tells about the Githyanki. They are creatures of pure will. I begin to research a magical spell. I will use it to craft a spell to channel mythic power into. 

Specifically its a mythic spell. Its specifically designed to disconnect a being from another plane. Its focus is a tiny silver sword. This will cost 1BP to make. It will take me 3 days.

## Later that night.
The call comes at night. A pink glow with pulsing green reflects off the Skyveil mists beyond the hidden horizon. Your supply holds creak as raw fruit and vegetables begin to sprout, growing through their containers. The crew grows restless as their eyes reflect the strange light, and you can almost see your brave men and women slowly fed [[Ragnorra]]'s essence.

I order my crew to dump anything that bursts out of its crates and barrels.

We call a meeting.

[[Voltaire]] gets the heart of [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] Vane. [[Voltaire]] has his heart in a cage.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] gets Gutterang and has it speak to him. [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] begins to mentally break down.

[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] talks to him, He says to write the sign he uses a tool. Its activation is a harmonic sound like music. [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] will have to activate it.

## Neth 27, 2348. Flying to Poopool.

I finish my **Planar Sunder** spell.

[[Jacob Stevens|Jacob]] begins to cast the **Life Ward** Ritual. We can see the effect. a Dim White glow.

[[Jacob Stevens|Jacob]] is still working on the Anti Life Bubble spell.

He teleports away.

We continue onward. We enter the point of no return.

[[Ragnorra]] manifested is an immense, roiling cloud of sickly pink growing into murky crimson, stretching across the sky like a grotesque thunderhead. Bright, viridescent veins snake erratically through the pink haze. They pulse sporadically with bursts of nauseating, greenish-yellow light, throbbing like a heartbeat in irregular patterns,.

Parts of the cloud occasionally condense into distorted, semi-formed shapes—limbs, mouths, and eyes—each grotesque semblance fading back into the pulsating mist as quickly as it appears. Faint whispers and an unsettling chorus of groans emanate from within, as if voices are trapped in her form, forever suffering in a state of half-existence. Any sense of true form eludes comprehension, lost in the chaos of [[Ragnorra]]’s swirling body.

"Under us!" calls a lookout.

A small wreck sails by at something more then ramming speed. The flying mass of destroyed civilization enduring a flash of neon green lightning that tears through and arcs over the hull before barreling directly into [[Ragnorra]]'s slightly less-than-corpeal carapace and meets with resistance as the front of it condenses and breaks, scrap metal splintered wood dust and stone exploding from the impact. The thing barrels on, losing more and more of it's mass before like a sword piercing armor it simply slides into the Elder Evil's body.
