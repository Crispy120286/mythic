## Neth 24, 2348. Itchy Dirt Island.

We go out for drinks before we are sacrificed to Sekhmet. We travel by skiff to the temple. We learn the priestess name is Karema. She offers the blood to the guardian and it enters the temple.

We see colossal obsidian doors. There is an obsidian guardian with tattoos of gold. Inside the temple is a massacre. Remains of traps, zombies, and ectoplasmic remains of wraiths. Navigating is easy. [[Voltaire]] is disappointed the thrill of exploration is ruined. apparently [[Irthicax Vane|Irthicax]] Vane took all the fun out of it by killing all the monsters and disarming or destroying all the traps.

We ascent to a large chamber. We see a mural of Sekhmet. A lion headed woman battling an army of humans.

I examine the statue and notice a faded inscription next to the stone vessels.

>"when the lioness thirsts for the blood of mortals, give her the nectar of life red as blood sweet as the earth."

[[Voltaire]] checks the murals and guesses the goddess is one of destruction. 

I decide to check out the murals myself. At some point some member of the pantheon got annoyed with mortals. the urals say Ra sent Hathor in the form of Sekhmet to destroy the mortals. Her bloodlust was not sated and almost wiped out the entire world and all of the mortals. The stop her Ra and the other gods gave her a river of beer dyed red like blood and she drank and got drunk and left. 

We can offer the beer dyed red.

Or we can also offer our blood.

I decide to identify the statue with detect magic. The statues mouth is vorpal.

We need the get the correct ration of beer to dye.

A MYTHIC HAS DIED

[[Voltaire]] decided to experiment. he got his head eaten by the statue. its okay though, it grew back.
Apparently 4/1 ration is NOT correct.

8 parts total. 

7-1
6-2
5-3
4-4

there are 13 murals.

Temple was inhabited by undead at one point. Once by living men. 

13 - 3 = 16 / 2 = 8! 

The ration is 1.5 Ocre to 6.5 Beer. The statue steps aside and we move onward.

We got it and we are able to go through. And now we come face to face with a huge Sphynx. 

## Sphinx Room.
As soon as we enter and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] enters and greets the sphynx.

#### Riddles.
"Before you pass, and dare the wrath,
Of one who walks destruction's path,
Where she lies in blood-stained halls,
The end of worlds, within her claws. "

"Voiceless it cries,
Wingless flutters,
Toothless bites,
Mouthless mutters."
(wind)

"Never resting, never still.
Moving silently from hill to hill.
It does not walk, run or trot.
All is cool where it is not."
(sun)

"I am born in fear, raised in truth, 
and I come to my own in deed.
When comes a time that I'm called forth, 
I come to serve the cause of need."
(courage)

## Sekhmet's Room
The sphynx moves aside and we move forward.
We see Sekhmet lounging on a throne in the middle of a room. She laughs. 

She lazily lifts a claw and it leaves a massive scratch on [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]]'s back. She calls him over with one claw. She slides off of her dais. We've seen [[the grove maiden]] and the stray god of loss and the hobgoblin chief. Our understanding of the gods is shallow. This is a major deity of an ancient pantheon with followers on worlds far away from Golarion.

"Your Divinity, Sekhmet, We come seeking [[Ragnorra]]'s sign. We tracked her down and hope to defeat her."

Damn she's drunk. She fell asleep.

She doesn't know where the sign is. She does give us permission to search the pharaohs room.
We see one room of gold, another in obsidian.

We enter the gold room. The pharaohs room is bare, he was robbed. On the zenith on the capstone is [[Ragnorra]]'s sign. 

I begin to read the sign.

Arcane
Planes
Geography

This rune is weirdly in flux, the top layer is shifting
The room begins to shift and oh shit that's an empowered symbol of stunning. The room begins to shift and adjust. The rune shifts and left the room and ran away. 

Every island we visited, something attacked us. This sign is a living rune. Its a living 2 dimensional being that can shift itself into symbols.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] twists off the capstone and its slides off the pyramid and scratches up the side of the pyramid. The Adamantine golem looks up.
