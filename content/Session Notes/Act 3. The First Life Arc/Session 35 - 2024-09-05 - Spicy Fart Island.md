# Journal
## Neth 14, 2348. Week 64. Spicy fart Island
Magma Elementals!

Tentacle things!

I cast See Invisibility. It doesn't reveal the tentacle things.

I recall a story.  A story about a vile creature they could not see and no magic could let them see it. The blood of Yog Soloth. 

[[Irthicax Vane]] Appears!

Hid [[Ragnorra]]'s sign behind a mythological monster. An Argus. A creature related to the Titans. Corrupted by the Gods. 

Malice Shapers, Cult that follows [[Ragnorra]] and twists her perfection. They're full of psychotics and madmen. They are or were here. The invisible Tentacle monsters are their works. 

POISON!

[[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] almost dies.
