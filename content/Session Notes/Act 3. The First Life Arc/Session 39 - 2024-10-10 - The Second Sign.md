## Neth 20, 2348. Piss Water Island.

Combat! We're fighting 3 Scrag's and an Aboleth.
I begin by casting Mythic Haste.

We defeat the aboleth.

I have something called Aboleth Lung and now i cannot breath air.

We navigate to the sign.

Arcane
Planes
Geography

This one was WAY easier to decipher than the last one.

We go back to the ship and have our meeting. We are headed towards Itchy Dirt Island next.

One of the sailors is nervous about where the Wreck is. We haven't seen it. The fog hides the smell.
