# Journal
## Erastus 2, 2347 AE. Early Evening.
- Victory!!
- The Prophet falls into the core.
- [[Rovagug|The rough beast]] looks away.
- We talk to [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] and talk to him about going to the hole left by the monk.
- There is a gentle breeze around him. very subtle and peaceful.
- "What is the great Dao?"
- Eastern philosophy. everything began with the great Dao. they can meditate and gain power from it.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] is now Mythic!
- He said he didn't have a choice. That the path will occasionally be forced upon us.
- wut? Was I sent here against my will? *twitch*
- I take a lap around the circle.
- I ask count Citro about setting a guard.
- We go back to the Citro estate.

### Citro Estate
- We all split up.
- [[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] says we cant use his manor right now.
- We go to the tenements. 
- I find [[Ember]] and tell her about [[Adeline Wolfe]]. 
- I go find a bed to sleep in for the night.

> [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] is roused from sleep at about 10pm. They're asking for [[Victor Kasune|Victor]]. Someone on the outskirts is asking for him. strange. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] tells them where [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] is, He was last seen going towards the aqueduct. They go to the outskirts. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] arrives first. Its a dwarf. Obviously very infected. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] arrives and the dwarf goes "Oh! it's good that you lived!". It's [[Cassius Morgan]].

## Erastus 3, 2347 AE.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] is the first awake. He's making beef stew.
- I prepare my spells with the others.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] says that [[Voltaire]] hasn't returned to the town last night.
- We discuss possible next actions.
- We meet with [[Aurora]] and then go to the Counts estate.
- Dean Ambros' life work was to grow float stones. He insisted he was very close to make new ones.

### Plans!
1. Secure the [[Float Stones]] and torch the underground.
2. Destroy the fungus tower. Its the furthest point of Citro's Estate.
3. Deal with the hivemind.
4. Investigate [[Luke]]'s house and the red bricks.

- We leave and track [[Voltaire]]. He managed to find and kill his halflings.
- Continuing onward we see he is going to [[Luke]]'s. 
- Its nightfall when we arrive.
- I cast Bull's Strength on [[Voltaire]], [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]].
- I cast it again on [[Aurora]] and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]]. 
- There is nothing interesting under [[Luke]]'s house.
- I spend the evening rolling linguistics on my contract tattoos.

## Erastus 4, 2347 AE.
- We prepare to head out and check out the spire on the underside of the island.
- We see the effects before we see the spire.
- We see small mushrooms and small and medium sized Scorpiders with their stingers and shells missing.
- We advance further. The mushrooms are getting bigger.
- We find some dead former residents of [[New Haven]]. Throats gouged out and bones broken. One is flayed.
- We find the spire... and it has been torn down! Its been torn chunk by chunk. It was originally over 40 feet tall.
- We feel it before we see it. A new sensation for me. It feels like my blood is on fire. like molten metal is flowing through my veins. We see [[Luke]] riding on top a 20ft tall Golem that's partly a boat. Its floating.
- [[Luke]] says "I got bored." in reference to the destroyed Spire "There are a few things I needs to explain. That's why I got to kick the monk out. [[Rovagug]] targets divinities. That's why stray divinities don't form a society. If you 6 remain together and build a perfect society it wont work, we will become targets. Second the hivemind is active but wounded. you cannot say it by normal means. it will never stop trying to grow. its consciousness is in each and every spore and mushroom it grows. but if you can isolate the consciousness you can trap it and seal it away as we did. and who knows maybe someday you can destroy a mind, thought. We were happy to throw it in a box and be done with it. The last thing I need to inform is for my old apprentice  [[Aurora]]. The infection cannot be cured by normal means, but you are not normal. Use the power you are given and cure it like any other."
- [[Luke]] only took parts of two Mythic's. Dex and Cha. 
- [[Voltaire]]. So in theory, one of us could give everything up to another as long as a deal was made.
- The world abhors monsters. Heroes jobs are to say the monsters.
- [[Luke]] just sails off...
- We go back to the Volusius estate.
- That night another Linguistics check on my tattoos.

## Erastus 5, 2347 AE. Evening
- Finally arrive back at Citro's estate.
- We see Belfast and he asks us to check out the Tin mind.
- We tell Citro about how we shouldn't stick around on the island for too long.
- He can get us a small skiff and it can get us to a Wreck and we can get that [[Float Stones]].
- We head onward towards the hole!
- Linguistics!
- The contract languages is a combination of Infernal, Celestial, and a dialect of Primordial. The words are purposefully overlapping and are moving. Chronus is a dick.

## Erastus 6, 2347 AE. 
- We're at the hole!... again...
- We search our way to get to the core of the island.
- we're all icky and slimy now after falling into people goop.
- Finally get to the inner lair after 6 hours of walking. We see the [[Float Stones]] in the center, the size of a breadbasket. We see the hole going deeper.
- I detect [[magic]] and don't find any auras.
- Multiple effects: Evocation and Illusion. Evocation is the Darkness spell, Illusion is the Silence spell.
- I try to dispel it twice. Fail each time. This was put here by ritual [[magic]]. I am guessing it was from the Archmage and a ton of backup war mages.
- Do we jump in?
- [[Voltaire]] is hesitant.
- We all jump! We fall, sink down. We enter the blackness. The featherfall ends before we can see.
