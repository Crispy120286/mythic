# Journal
## Sarenith 23, 2347 AE. Sunset.
- We begin in [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]].
- So many zombies outside.
- [[Aurora]] casts delay poison on us all and Barkskin on [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]].
- I cast Clayskin on [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]].
- There's about 70 outside according to [[Victor Kasune|Victor]].
- We are discussing plans, We need to get to the north gate through the training yard. The wall there has a 20 foot broken section.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] scouts again, We are very much surrounded. He tries to provoke them by tossing a rock down on them. They start climbing up the side of the building and a few are on the roof.
- We need a board or door or slab. We decide on to Kyuss' chalkboard. Its stuck on by Sovereign Glue.
- [[Aurora]] and I go down to the lab to make some Universal Solvent. We get 5 uses.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Voltaire]] think we're being funneled. They are guiding us to an exit of their choice.
- We continue planning for our escape.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] makes a cauldron of stuff. It begins to bubble and froth. He leaves it at the top hole exit. 
- I case Invisibility, Mirror Image, and Fly.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Voltaire]] opens the door and toss out the slab.
- I immediately cast Mythic Haste on everyone.
- I fly out of the school. The zombies are blocking off the other exits. They're waiting for us. They're swarming. There is indeed a single safe path to the south. They're funneling us.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] steps outside and the horde swarms forward.
- I look around. They are blocking off the roads and alleys to the north.
- I see 10ft. tall mushrooms! they quiver as if they're trying to hold still.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] single handedly takes out the horde and the mushrooms rise up and throw buildings at him! He takes it like a champion.
- We need to move!
- The horde has been listening to us and heads south to cut us off. [[Voltaire]] says we need to go True North! ...so we go West!
- We cut through the training grounds and I cast Create Pit on the horde in an alley way and we make our escape outside of town.
- [[Aurora]] and [[Voltaire]] argue. [[Voltaire]] killed her tribe and propositioned her mother. Stole a key that didn't work. He says [[Aurora]] was a liar and has been hiding [[Luke]].
- [[Aurora]] runs away.
- [[Voltaire]] gives context. Elven gods are mostly dead. They stopped hearing the voices of the elves and lost power. Corellion was the former head of the pantheon. His stopped hearing prayers and his protection ended. [[Voltaire]] went from village to village looking for something. He was looking for something to forge his armor. His armor is a corruption is a linking of unity. Auroras village attacked him first and his crew suppressed them. After that he took the token. They kept attacking him. Auroras tribe was a fake and it didn't even work. He did eventually find all the pieces he needed and his armor was made.
- We go to the aquafer.
- [[Voltaire]] and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] go outside and have a "talk".
- I have my familiar help decipher the contract on my body. 
>**Linguistics Check Roll 35.**
- sleep.
