# Journal
## Erastus 2, 2347 AE.
- RUN AWAY!
- I cast FLY on [[Voltaire]].
- We continue to try and escape
- We get to the hole in the ceiling. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and I get through the hole but the Scorpider reaches us and digs through the hole and pins us. Ow...
- [[Aurora]] dies... :(
- [[Aurora]] lives! :D
- The monk uses a lay on hands to raise her. 
- We're still stuck!!
- It crushes us and I fall unconscious. 
- The others down below manage to knock the Scorpider off the ceiling and it falls down into the depths below.
- We find ourselves into the brood room. We continue towards the exit.
- Following the potato vines we continue outward. 
- *Rumble rumble*
- Its ahead of us! we hide and it tramples down the hall and hits [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Voltaire]].
- Continuing outward we find the sandy hallways.
- Invoking the goddess the makes the vines
- It chases us the whole way.
- We finally get out.

### Outside.
- The goddess revealed her plan to me so listen up...
- The ground shakes again.
- What we need to do is *Blast of purple energy disintegrates the monk*
- What the fuck...
- There is a hole where the monk was and a hole in the clouds. We see a massive eye. Its sees us. [[Rovagug]]!
- The people manning the siege engines begin killing eachother.
- We see the dagger. It flies off. it's in a rock in the distance.
- Its making an arena!
- Battle starts.

### Final Battle.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] shoots it with a Ballista. I head over and launch the Trebuchet.
- The goddess speaks and she shoots at [[Rovagug]]. The makes a cloud over the area.
- There is a gurgle and the cloud dissipates again.
-  [[Rovagug]] is attacking us.
- The Scorpider is his with two ballista's total now and both rocks are in the atmosphere.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] hits it again and begins to take the rock to one of the good trebuchets.
- They begin to reset it for another shot.
- I yell to get [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] into the hole! The monks Mythic item must be inside. Toss [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] inside so he can take his trial.
- [[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] says he is on it. 
- I use my power to re-memorize a spell. I get Liberating Command.
- We get hit by [[Rovagug]] light. ouch!
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] aims and shoots it with an arrow in its weak spot.
- We hear a screech of rage and it begins to rise into the sky.
- The eye turns away from us. We survived.
