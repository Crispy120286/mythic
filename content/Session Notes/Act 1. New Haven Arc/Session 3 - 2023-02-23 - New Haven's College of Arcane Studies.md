# Log
## Sarenith 12, 2347 AE. Late
##### Late Day 4 (continued)
We're sail on back to the City of [[New Haven]] on the counts skiff. This whole Edge Work Duty has been a terrifying ordeal. As we come in sight of the city the tower has fully rebuilt its 4 docks. We dock our ship upto the closest one and head on in.

Everything seems cleaner than it was before. [[Count Citro Volusius]] is sitting at a table rolling bones with two guards whom I dont know the bnames of. [[Count Citro Volusius|The Count]] has been cleaning and making adjustments to the tower. We turn in the 8 monster crystals we retrieved from the tunnels beneath the island. 

[[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] gives us our next mission. He wants us to contact the local goddess, [[The Grove Maiden]]. she watches over the island. She controls the weather and gains power through prayer of the inhabitants of the island.

We are to rest up for a few days and go speak to her.

I request a private audience with [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]]. He says to meet here tomorrow morning.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] tells [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]] about the green mushrooms and how he gave them to [[Luke]] in exchange for potions. We need to have our potions we receive from [[Luke]] vetted through [[The Gamblers Brew]]. 

[[Count Citro Volusius|The Count]] tells [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] he gave him his wages in salt. I ask about that and show [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]] a silver piece that I used as currency. [[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] explains again that this island uses a barter system and most trade is done through salt. I have deduced that one pound of salt is approximately 50 gold pieces of my home currency.

I ask to speak to the [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies]]. He will accept me at my convenience. The deans name is [[Ambros Moxley]]. He assumes the other students will introduce themselves to me in good time.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] accidentally gives up that he got an Iron rod to [[Count Citro Volusius|the Count]]. I casually mention the rope and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] is grumpy with me. I tell [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] he shouldnt have mentioned the rod in the first place. We are dismissed.

I stay at the guard house with [[Count Citro Volusius|The Count]] when [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] head out. [[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] tells me that the thieves guild activity is on the rise in the City of [[New Haven]] lately. He isn't sure why [[Zerg]] hasn't cleared out [[The Crow's Nest]]. He lets me stay there in a hammock. [[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] receives a missive and is called away. I lie down into a hammock and relax writing in this journal.

#### Off Screen
[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] speaks to [[Cassius Morgan]]. Cassius is in the guise of a woman today. Cassius wants to set up a meeting with [[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]].

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] goes to the brewery to meet with [[Zerg]]. [[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] was making him clean and do work.

## Sarenith 13, 2347 AE. Day 5. 
[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] wakes first. He receives his salt shipment and rations.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] wakes next and goes to get water. He hangs out with some of the guards.

The bustle of the guardhouse  shortly after dawn wakes me up. They complaining about [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]]. I drink some water and eat some potato. I don't have a cup for water. I need to borrow [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]]'s and then go out later today to buy one for myself.

#### Later in the morning
We get our food rations and salt. I wait to speak to [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]] at the guard tower. I ask him about [[Kian Volusius]]. He doesnt recognise the name from any of his family tree. He thinks I am under a mind whammy. A hazing ritual done by the students of [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]]. That's why [[Ambros Moxley|the dean]] agreed to see me so readily. I ask about the island. I ask him about how long the island has been floating. He says since about 500AE or so. AE stands for  After the End. This year is 2347AE. That doesn't make any sense, so I tell him the real date. Its 1323 EC, or 4723 AR. He isn't sure when that calendar ended. This doesn't make any sense! Perhaps I have been enchanted? He knows I am a noble from my bearing. He tells me I need to speak to [[Ambros Moxley|the dean]] to clear this up. I bow then clasp wrists with him and leave. I need to go to [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]].  

Deep breaths [[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]].

I meet with [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]]. We head out to [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]]. As we're travelling we meet [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and pass through the central square. 

There a strange man named Vicemi begins talking to us about a duel at noon? He seems like a crazy person.

With my salt stipend I buy a mug! A simple tin stein with a lid on top.

We go to the center and see a man called Inigo. He tells another man, Rugen, that he killed his father and to prepare to die. It appears to be a show. Public theater! Thats what Vicemi was talking about earlier.

##### Haven's College of Arcane Studies
We continue past the central square to [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]]. Its longer and wider than all the buildings in the city. Its surrounded by a large outer wall. The entrance is up a series of steps. The doors are closed but people are guarding the door, actually a leather tarp, wearing the uniform and symbol of the school. A [[Float Stones]] in an hourglass. I announce myself, [[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] Colorion to meet with Dean [[Ambros Moxley]]. They tell us where we are to go. It appears in the center in a spiraling corridors going deep into the ground. I knock on the wooden doorframe of the door I was told to go. Out steps a well build man with fading hair. well built. Wearing leather jerkin, pants, and leather sandals. He looks better build than [[Zerg]].

He introduces himself as [[Ambros Moxley]]. He tells us that there were three students due to arrive at the school and only one arrived, he thinks I may be one of the two missing students. I tell him that I don't think I am a student as I already attended seven years at [[Akadimia Mageias]]. Thats not a name he recognises so he lists off a few schools to see if I'm from there. The Wyverns Roost School of Arcane Arts, The Lumos Academy, and the Arcanum Academy. The Arcane Academy sounds like the common translation of [[Akadimia Mageias]]. [[Ambros Moxley|The Dean]] says we need to meet with [[Kyuss]], the Professor of Necromancy. Maybe he can elaborate. He also wants the schools Transmuter, [[Alaric Stone]], to look at my spellbook. He asks to see what I have with me, I tell him all the items I have on me. I show him my Colorion signet ring but he tells me that the Colorion line is gone, most of the items they found are ancient. I also show him Ioun, my Familiar.

We go to see [[Alaric Stone]], [[Ambros Moxley|The Dean]] escorts me there personally. I introduce myself. [[Alaric Stone]] stone is an Alchemist and [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the College]]'s Transmutation Professor. We go to [[Kyuss]] room. Its a room to lecture and teach. [[Ambros Moxley|The dean]] tells him to say hello. The chalkboard has writing that appears on it. [[Kyuss]] writes that isn't available but can hear and understand us clearly enough. Must be some sort of scrying effect. I dont know how to reasd the language yet so [[Kyuss]] writes in both Elven and [[New Haven]] Common. [[Alaric Stone]] wants to see my Spellbook so i show him. The Alaric's spellbook is written on his bronze belt. Alaric confirms that my spellbook is real. He leaves to continue his studies.

The chalkboard writes "What years is it?", I respond that Its 1323 EC, or 4723 AR. The chalkboard responds that the AR calendar was retired in the year 5444. He talks of [[Rovagug]] breaking from his prison. I ask about where the float stones come from. [[Ambros Moxley|The dean]] isn't certain. he thinks they are some sort of artifact, the Chalkboard cuts in and reminds him of the announcement. 

The chalkboard gives me the Rosetta Stone for the language. 

I ask about the timeline and about the AE. "After the End". [[Kyuss]] begins to tell him of the breaking of the world. I am suddenly overcome with PTSD as I remember the events of what happened the day the world broke apart under my feet.

The Colorion line is NOT DEAD!

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] escorts [[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] to his new room. They're a solid 10x10. I need to carve my name into a stone panel. I don't have anything to carve with.

[[Ambros Moxley|The Dean]] puts me under the care of Professor [[Jacob Stevens]]. 

A man with slicked black sandy hair. He asks me if I am [[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] Colorion, I say yes and he casts a spell and puts me to sleep. Failed the save.

Zzz

He asks me if I am okay, I say yes and he attempts to cast another spell on me. I pass the save.

He tells me to call him Professor Stevens. First rule is to expect a fight. The world is not safe.  He threatens to keep me ready and challenge me at all times. He leaves after that threat.

We go and explore the school. There are 10 dedicated classrooms. Only 7 are active and 3 are empty. There are 30 Labs or experimentation rooms. The classrooms are enchanted to block sound from going in or out of them. There are 8 classes for each of the schools, a generalist, and [[Ambros Moxley|the dean]]. Spiral staircases underground lead to storerooms, and security offices. [[Adeline Wolfe]], Head of Security is listed above the security office. The central area is listed of the Library. Its all written on the stone tablets all along the walls.

We meet a local student [[Felix]]. I introduce myself. He warns me about students and the hazing. I ask him about Professor Stevens. He has high expectations of those around him. He is a sorcerer. His lessons are about staying alive, winning the fights, and accomplishing your goals. He says if I need to learn about the professors go into their classrooms. 

I go to meet some of the professors. I've already met, Necromancy Professor [[Kyuss]]. Transmutation Professor [[Alaric Stone]]. Generalist Professor [[Jacob Stevens]]. 

We go to the Conjuration Professor. Her presence is serene and calming. She gives us a polite and genuine smile. Professor [[Luna Starweaver]]. I introduce myself. Say hello to [[Adeline Wolfe]]. She suggests I speak to Professor [[Ember]] of Evocation and Professor [[Seiðr]] of Divination.

I head over to the laboratory of evocation. I see a woman. She seems very skittish and seems to has social anxiety. She is very skittish. she remained crouching and shaking in the corner the whole time.

Once again, Professor [[Jacob Stevens]] casts grease under me and I fall.
