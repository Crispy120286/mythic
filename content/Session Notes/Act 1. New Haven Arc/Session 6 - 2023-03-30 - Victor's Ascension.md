# Journal
## Sarenith 22, 2347 AE.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] doesn't have any scars anymore!
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] tells us he isn't the only one like this. [[Voltaire]] also has a piece.
- [[Zerg]] was immolated and left all his stuff behind.
- I detect magic. [[Zerg]]'s cloak, hide armor, axe is magic. He also has a magic shirt.
- I try and identify them. The cloak is a Cloak of Resistance +1 with Endure Elements. The armor is +1 hide armor. The shirt is a Quick Runners Shirt. I am unable to identify the weapon.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] takes the Cloak and Armor. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] takes the Shirt. We put the magical axe into the group loot.
- There is a bamboo scroll case and a couple potions in the room as well. We aren't able to identify the scroll.
- With a more thorough search of the room we find some weapons.
- We find a wand! Mage Armor. 22 charges.
- We continue out back to the Paladins by following my map.
- The Paladins go back into the maze to retrieve the food. We head out and get read to go to [[The Distillery]].
- the hivemind buried the door with rocks and sand! we cant get out.
- We try the other entrance to [[The Giving Hand]].

### Cutscene!
- a dozen of the horde go to the carapace of the scorpion and get handfuls of the spikes.

### [[The Giving Hand]]
- We get the rubble out of the doorway.
- There are footfalls on the other side running away.
- We go outside. There's a man running away being chased by 6 infected.
- As soon as I step outside 5 of them break off and run towards... me?
- We run down the street. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] takes us to his safehouse. We make it downstairs and the man catches up. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] opens the secret entrance to an underground tunnel. 
- We all get in and the man jumps down, the infected follow and I Burning Arc one of them. We escape down the other side. 
- On the other side we hide. The man is a bard!
- [[Orist Zinorin]]. The Maestro of the bard troop.
- We introduce ourselves.
- [[Aurora]] leave as a bird to go speak with [[the grove maiden]].
- the paladins leave to go to the counts manor.
- We take the bard with us.

### [[The Distillery]]
- The door has been pried open by the infected with the sharp barbed spikes.
- Its obvious the infected has been in here. The large stone basins have some dead infected floating in the water.
- We explore. The floor has a slight slant downward. A single door at the end.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] picks the lock and it opens.
- The door has a "Hold Portal" trap on it. Its on a timer. If we don't finish in time, It'll lock us in.
- Inside there is natural stone. not the yellow stone from topside. This isn't natural here.
- 100 feet down we see a strange thing at the base of the stairs.
- Its a number puzzle!
- After a lot of experimenting, I discover it was the Fibonacci sequence.
- We go down a hole. Inside there are indentations for the buttons. I place them in a spiral pattern.
- There's a spiral staircase downward.
- Water pours in! 20 holes and 20 keys. The room floods.
- I get back upstairs, [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] dives down and solves it. It was the prime numbers.

### [[Victor Kasune|Victor]]
- Dark room. There's a figure that greets him. "What do you seek?" asks the figure.
- "I seek my true calling" says [[Victor Kasune|Victor]].
- "I'll give you what you seek in exchange for killing the man that took it from me."
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] magical transformation! Lightning surges across his body.

### Back in the real world
- The room is flooding, Only [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] can see the mechanisms. He's fast.
- The water begins to drain. the trap door begins to open. Another door begins to open.
- Inside is the Aquaphor, the last water on the island.
