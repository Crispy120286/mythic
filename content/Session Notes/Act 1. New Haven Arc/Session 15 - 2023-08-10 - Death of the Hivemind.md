# Journal
## Erastus 6, 2347 AE. 
- we fall and take 30 damage
- [[Aurora]] channels and heals us.
- The chamber is large and we see a light in the distance.
- We walk close to it and we hear the chitinous sounds of crawling on the walls and ceiling around us.
- Around 200 feet away. [[Voltaire]] and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] tell "Negotiate, Negotiate" I managed to resist its effect.
- "Leave this island to me and I wont spread further." yeah bullshit.
- We converse with the brain of the hivemind. Its a white glowing mushroom.
- [[Aurora]] sets the white mushroom on fire!
- [[Voltaire]] and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] rush forward and I create pit underneath them.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] kills the small Scorpider
- [[Aurora]] hits it with another fire spell.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] and [[Voltaire]] begin fighting.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] jumps down in and tries to stop them.
- I cast web into the hole and suddenly i'm overwhelmed with a massive headache. 
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Aurora]] channel the power of Mythic and kill the brain of the hivemind... we think.
- There was a little alcove where the mushroom was and its destroyed.
- As far as I can tell. The hivemind is gone. 
- We explore the dug out cave for a big.
- Finding a tunnel to go back up we wind ourselves in the mushroom room. They stopped spewing spores. Going to the bug room and the nanny bugs are immobile. The baby Scorpiders are still hatching.
- We finally exit the tunnels and decide to head back towards the city. I think we should inform [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]] because order should be restored to [[New Haven]].
- We arrive at the counts estate a bit after nightfall.
- It turns out [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]] headed towards [[New Haven]].

### [[New Haven]]. Midnight
- We see the town and Citro is keeping order.
- Citro says that there is a swarm of bugs at [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]].
- That must be Kaius.
- We talk to him

## next day
- We sleep at the guard house and loot it.
- get stuff from Zergs room.
- we meet with [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]].


- We have a week to play. we have 7000gp to play with for magic items.
- 2bp total.


4000gp for Headband of Vast Intellect.
2000gp for Handy Haversack.
1000gp for Boots of the Cat.

I research the history. The Archmage passed about 300 years ago. I am caught up with everything that has happened since I was temporally misplaced.

[[Voltaire]] makes a grand attempt at getting forgiven by [[Aurora]].

- I can learn 8 spell levels from the alchemist list.
- We leave.

## 7 days later. 
- We got our stuff.

## Erastus the 14th.
- We leave.
- The wreck comes in view.
