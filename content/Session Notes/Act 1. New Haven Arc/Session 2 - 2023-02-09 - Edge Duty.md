# Log
## Sarenith 10, 2347 AE. Day Two
We have just finished gathering supplies from [[The Dry Pencil]]. We have enough food and water for the 3 day trip. 

The air is dry. There is no breeze. I see [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|The College]] to the north. 

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] say we have another task before we go. We go to the potion shop called [[The Gamblers Brew]]. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] ties off the boat to an abandoned building. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] climb down the rope. I stay in the ship. Not because I'm afraid of climbing down, nope!

I see a weird halfling toss something into the abandoned building and a purplish smoke starts to rise. uh oh. Now I'm itchy. I would learn this halflings name is [[Iraace Bigbarrel]]. He's a quite eccentric halfling.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] come back. They purchased 5 healing potions and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] scraped some stuff from the refuse pile in the abandoned building. 

Off to the edge! [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says its 15-20 miles from the City of [[New Haven]] . But first we have to stop by this "crazy person". His name is [[Luke]]. 

We sail over the walls, already repaired from the monster attack. Yellow craggy sandy terrain as far as the eye can see. I don't see life anywhere. This is wrong. So very very wrong. Just yellow brown dunes and rocks. There's no breeze! [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] doesn't know why. He says that [[New Haven|New Haven]] doesn't have that. But that its way better then Old Haven, according to [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]]. 

Six hours into our journey we see a shape in the distance, 12 miles or so. As we sail closer we see its a small ruined hamlet. Among all the broken buildings we see exactly one building  that is whole. We see an leathery old man. This must be [[Luke]]. He looks up and grins at us with a nearly perfect grin. He points to a pile of rocks and we hook our boat to it. 

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] talks to him about potions. It appears that [[Luke]] is the one who makes them. He is indeed very crazy. Is he a necromancer? He is talking about controlling undead moving his rocks around. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] cant talk to him and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] tells him why. [[Luke]] says he is a healer as well and takes [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] down into his house.

[[Luke]] comes out and says success! [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] can talk again as his jaw is good. He claims to be the second best doctor on the island but cant answer who the first is. 

We sail onward to the edge. The edge is a sort of steep sloping hill about half a mile long. Its just loose sand all the way around but it isn't falling. What?! 

Its beginning to get dark as the sun sets and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says its time to set camp. We all sit around one tiny burning mushroom. We eat some dried meats, nuts, and water.

I decide to go to bed. The sun finally sets and I see the night sky for the first time. The moon is cracked! I'm in hell.

Knowledge Arcana (24). The stars are wrong! Some are missing, the constellations are out of place, and there are new stars. The night sky looks just off enough to looks familiar but wrong. I just stare up at the sky.

Studying the sky. The moon looks like it is my moon, just off. like something hit it. I'm in hell.

## Sarenith 11, 2347 AE. Day 3. 
I was hoping I would wake up in my comfortable bed in home but nope. I'm still in hell. I eat a potato. That is a delicious potato. We begin edge duty.

We sail off the edge! Gravity is incredibly strange. We stay level with the side as it slopes off but gravity is always "down". As we get to the apex of the side I see the clouds on the underside. 

Upon the underside we start to check for holes. Its at this point I discover that this really is a floating island and that [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] wasn't lying. Cue existential dread. 

I figure out that if the island was hit from the bottom side that's what would have tilted it. We have been searching the wrong side the whole morning, we head back to the other side and continue our search. I am continuing to converse in [[New Haven|New Haven]] Common and believe i have a grasp on it to speak fluently.

On the other side of the bottom of the island we discover a hole in the sand about 10 feet in diameter. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says that is the hole we need to investigate and there is almost certainly a monster inside.

It is roughly 4pm now. The sun is slightly illuminating the area as it passes over the other side of the island. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] learns this hole is a sink hole, but the right hole is on the other side so we go to the other side to the correct hole. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] climbs down skillfully. I on the other hand get twisted in the rope and I fall. Ouch.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] pull me up with rope. We go down the right hole. As we venture forth we hear voices ahead. Hobgoblins! [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] moves forward and gets stabbed with javelins. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] draws a bow and shoots one. I cast light on the mushroom torch and toss it in the corridor. I try and cast Ray of Frost three times but I keep missing. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] manage to defeat all 4 of them but took some damage.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] heal up and we continue onward. 

I ask about the crystals. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says that [[Rovagug]] spits out monsters. I know about [[Rovagug]]. Imprisoned in the center of Golarion. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says that [[Rovagug]] is angry and the monsters want to dig into the underside of the island to get to the [[Float Stones]]. I don't understand. 

We search this room, it appears to be scraped out from the rock by hand. We move on to the next room.

As we venture down we notice three goblinoid creatures with distended stomachs that rush ahead and spit a burning fiery substance on us. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] cuts one down and it explodes and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] falls unconscious. They keep spitting the fiery substance but [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] manages to dispatch them. We are injured. We give [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] a potion and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and I take a potion each and heal up.

We investigate the next room and find some stuff!

| Loot                                    | Description | Who took |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Assorted items taken from the New Haven | Misc items  |          |

After discussing our next course of action we decide to move onward to the next room. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] drinks the last of our potions and we drudge onward. The next room appears to be empty but after searching we find a 20 foot long rope. At the next area we see a few sacks and a 5 foot long pole.

Suddenly from the ceiling we are attacked by a gargoyle! It keeps going after me. I manage to cast Shield and I'm attempting to protect myself from its sharp talons. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] pummels it and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] hits it with his axe. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] grabs it by its tail and drags it off the ceiling and punches it to death.

| armbands (magic)       | Armbands of the Brawler         |          |

The rope [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] picked up is magic. The rope is called Iron Rope. The only thing we find in the cave is a circle of white green mushrooms. We put them in a sack to ask someone about them later.

We have collected a total of 8 crystals of varying sizes.

## Sarenith 12, 2347 AE. Day 4. 

We finish the edge duty and find one more hole on the underside of the island. It is dead center in the island. At first it appears to be small but it is 40 feet long and 20 feet tall. We see some rocks falling "up". They part the clouds. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] argues it will take too long to get to the City of [[New Haven|New Haven]] and that we should investigate the hole. I suggest we go to [[Luke]] and restock some potions before we investigate it. We have no potions.

We sail to [[Luke]]'s and arrive by nightfall. 

[[Luke]] says the green mushrooms are poisonous and he seems oddly angry about them. He leaves and goes into his house. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] follows him and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and I wait outside. [[Luke]] is going to make us potions and deliver them to the Guard Tower in the City of [[New Haven]].

We should go back to town and resupply.
