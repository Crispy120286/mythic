###### Housekeeping
- [x] Metamixing Exploit: The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to add a metamagic feat that she knows to a spell as she casts it without affecting the casting time (though using a higher-level spell slot as normal). She can use this ability to add a metamagic feat to a spell that she prepared using a metamagic feat, although she cannot add the same metamagic feat to a given spell more than once.
	- [x] I read it as functioning for the spontanious casting of an arcanist. however for a wizard would it work closer to a Rod? I just need to know if it is worth taking or not.
- [x] Are you allowing Greater Exploits for Exploiter Wizard?

# Log
Mythic!
## Day One. Sarenith 9.
**Day one**
[[Victor Kasune]] with [[Cassius Morgan]]- His Mentor. He goes to his final stop. the Drowning Swan Inn. 6 foot 6 Orc guard captain [[Zerg]]. 

I'm waking up. My ankle is very swollen. My everything hurts. I see a dwarf. He's speaking in a language I don't know. The dwarf hands me a drink. I drink. Cool and refreshing. I'm lying on a pie of leather scraps in an entirely stone room. I speak to him in Old Dwarven. I ask him where I am. He says I talk like his grandpa. I'm in a place called the City of [[New Haven]], The shittiest place on the whole "island". He says water is luxury. what?

[[Zerg]] comes crashing in with Victor. Puts him in an adjacent cell. 

I ask his name, he is [[Sigmund Ragehammer]], I tell him my name.

I try and cast prestidigitation. It doesn't clean. the rest of the effects works as normal.

I see my stuff is missing. I ask Sigmund for them but he says " You don't know how prison works, do you?"

[[Zerg]] holds up my spellbook not too gently and asks what it is. I tell him (Sigmund translates) and he says "oh" and just tosses it aside.

Suddenly the tower tips! gravity is weird. The bell starts ringing. [[Zerg]] gives me my stuff back. We go outside.

We see a gargantuan bird, a Roc! Carrying a platoon of hobgoblins. flanks by 20 or 30 gargoyles, Ogres are rising on the bird as well. What the hell?! 

I am so far from home. City is a large circular area. I could have sworn i was on the ocean but there are ships docked above me, they're pushing off and sailing away thru the air. What?! The tower were in is at least 60 or 70 feet tall.

We're on a 50'x20' platform from the tower. 

Judging by the wind... I think there is more than one Roc.

Sigmund drags me along, He says he's on babysitting duty and that we need to fight them. I cant fight them! 

I see a ship with metal lighting stuff on fire sailing towards the Rocs. 

Suddenly a regiment of hobgoblins start marching towards us in military fashion.

I get hurt badly (I'm down to 1hp from 22hp). I managed to cast Mage Armor but failed to cast Shield. My head hurts so bad. I hobbled away to the tower and found there's nothing I can hide behind or do. Suddenly the dower shakes with large footfalls. Oh no... Its the Ogres. I cast Enlarge Person on Sigmund. Sigmund goes down. Still hiding in the tower I ready Create Pit if any of the Ogres get into the room. Victor gets Bull-rushed into the room. The Ogre reaches in and gets into a grapple battle with him. I get off a Mirror Image and try to get the Ogre with Ray of Frost. I keep losing most of my spells because of my wobbly head. Victor goes down. Sigmund is up again! He kills the Ogre!

The Ogre disappears into an inky black smoke and a crystal drops to the ground.

A man named [[Kyle]] picks it up and puts it into a pot with other crystals. He was the spellcaster from outside. It isn't magical and I'm not sure what it is. Sigmund doesn't know what they are but they drop from most of the monsters. But they can trade them to the school. School! There's a school!

Sigmund says that this sort of monster raid is common and happens every once in a while. The monsters were really suicidal. 

Zerg comes in with a spear through the shoulder.

I ask Sigmund the language he is speaking. He says its the common language of the island. What island is this? The island is New Haven. Something about Edge duty.

Someone walks in who I know is a Holy Man but he wears a... potato around his neck rather than a traditional holy symbol. He removes the spear from Zerg and begins healing everyone.

I attempt to decipher the language. I have no idea what it is they speak here at New Haven.

The holy man inspects my head. He wraps my head. He says my head will be fine in about a day and my leg in about a week. I ask Sigmund what his name was. He is [[Belhorn]]. 

Sigmund says that the only bed I can go to has real beds but they cost Salt. I'm confused as to why they don't use gold, silver, or copper. Sigmund says they trade. Sigmund also says he's going to take me to Edge Duty. It sounds something like 

I go back into my "cell" to sleep. Sigmund tosses me more scraps and I get some rest. Sigmund goes down to sleep. Victor goes back to his mentor.

I rest for a bit. 

Victor comes to me, He cant speak because of his jaw but we converse in dwarven writing on the wall. He says [[Voltaire]] would want my Colorion Ring and my Books because paper is rare. He isn't a good person. He was the one with the warship we saw attacking the Roc.

Sigmund and Victor are curious about my journal. They don't have paper?! They don't have trees. Sigmund says that the school writes all their magic on slabs. We argue about the island again. Something about the edge of the island, float stones, drilling, airships. I don't understand it. It sounds like slang of some sort. [[Steven]] comes in. He's another one of the guards. Goes to find Kyle.

I sleep for a bit. In the evening we get Double Rations!!

Zerg wanders in. He appears to speak in first person.

Sigmund lets me sleep in a bunk in the guards room. I elevate my leg. Before I go to bed I inspect the Ioun Wyrd.

## Day Two. Serenith 10.
I wake up. Follow Sigmund outside to get waters,

Belhorn comes up and refills the tin water bucket. We go back in and use the water to bathe. Belhorn does his second round of healing.

I prepare my spells in one of the open jail cells I woke up in yesterday. Its the only quiet place I can find.

After we're ready, we see [[Count Citro Volusius|The Count]]'s ship coming in from the distance. Its the size of a rowboat and there's only one person on it.

Zerg purposefully hurts himself and leaves. Kyle and Steven leaves. Sigmund looks upset he's left to deal with the Count. He says its my fault he's here because he has to babysit me.

The Count docks, He isn't a tall or imposing man. He's in a farmer soiled clothing, barefoot, and has an iron sword. 

He goes thru a few languages before we settle on even. He asks about where I am from. I mention [[Exypnos]] and the Empire. He asks about the Mage School. He says he will contact the [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies]]. They are supposed to have an "announcement" today but after the attack they will most likely postpone it.

He introduces himself as [[Count Citro Volusius]]. I am going to be sent with Sigmund and Victor to ring the gong, go get rations, and go do edge work. He is letting us use his skiff. The skiff doesn't even feel like its moving. it flies! 

The city is all stone building and most have tarps for roofs. The streets are all packed dirt. The city is surrounded by a big stone wall. Further outside the city is desert.

Sigmund helps me learn some language. I also ask him how the Skiff actually flies. He says its because of the [[Float Stones]]. Victor comes back and parkours into the skiff. He tells me the Island is called [[New Haven]]. We "sail" to the bell now. Sigmund attached the skiff to a build and climbs down. There is a noble who has food who distributes it to the residents of the island. I stay in the skiff with Victor. Sigmund got the rations for us, 3 days worth.

Suddenly the gong sounds. Its so loud!! We were moored right next to it. 

Sigmund comes back to the skiff with all the food. He says we need to make a detour back to the guardhouse to get the supplies for the trip to the edge. We go down the tower and towards the market square. We see jugglers and magic users doing shows. We're accosted by someone telling us about a show world famous composer Orist Zeinnorin, With a small brass orchestra. He will be performing for the rest of the week. 

We continue onwards to [[The Dry Pencil]] to get supplies. Its a wider stone building from most. The sign is a rock in the shape of a pencil with the dip darkened by charcoal to represent lead. Its a junk shop. We tell the aged man who runs the shop the Count sent us to get supplies for edge work. Sigmund and Viktor buy rope. They trade salt and herbs for it. Strange, they don't trade in gold. 

We get back in the skiff and and sail onward.
