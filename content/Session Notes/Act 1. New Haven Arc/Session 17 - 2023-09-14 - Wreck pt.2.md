## Erastus the 14th.
- The ratfolk are below our hiding place. Combat is inevitable.
- I cast Invisibility.
- I use my wand of Mage Armor.
- We see a ball of antimagic strike the window of the rope trick and it collapses and we fall.
- I cast fly and rise up. Im hit with a glitter dust and then two darts strike me. 
- I cast shield and huddle myself inside the crows nest for cover.
- We win the combat with them running away.
- [[Aurora]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] scout for a hiding place.
- We sleep for the night.

## Erastus the 15th.
- We continue onward. We find a weird gravity thing. 
- Its a couple miles to our next destination.
- We see a castle inhabited by gulley dwarves and they have a ton of catapults.
- nope!
- We go around. another 5 or so hours. 
- We find a glassy area. 
- Theres a battle between Gully Dwarves and Ratfolk. We sneak by them.
- We go down an icky hole with noxious gas. we have to swim through it.
- We encounter Hungry Fogs.
- Then we find ourselves in the source of the ick.
