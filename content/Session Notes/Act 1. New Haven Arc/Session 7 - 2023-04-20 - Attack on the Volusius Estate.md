# Journal
## Sarenith 22, 2347 AE.
- We see white blue lightning engulfing [[Victor Kasune|Victor]]. It shocks me!
- The water begins to drain. There is a cloak and a shirt underneath.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says "Welcome to the club" to [[Victor Kasune|Victor]]. This must be the power thing?
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] gets the loot.
- I identify. Quick-runners shirt, and Cloak of Resistance +1 with Lead Blades.
- We climb back up
- Its getting on afternoon.
- We manage to get out quite easily, The aquafer leads to the aqueduct which leads directly to the nobles estate.

### 2 hours later. 
- Towards the Volusius Estate.
- We see a small arrow made of stones pointing towards one of the pillars.
- [[Orist Zinnorin]] finds a hidden door but doesn't know how to open it.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] manages to open it. The door swings inward.
- There's a bit of magical light coming from down a spiral staircase.
- This goes deep!
- We hear [[Voltaire]]. He welcomes us. 
- "My brothers in power!" He says to [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]]. "[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] my friend!" he hugs [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]].
- The Volusius' have evacuated.
- [[The Grove Maiden]] is screaming about getting her champion back.
- The mines are gone.
- Jacob Survived. Not surprising really.
- We tell [[Voltaire]] what we found and how we found it.
- We get steak and potato's!
- He offers us some vodka.
- [[Voltaire]] is strangely kind to us all. He isn't anything like what I would have expected.
- Wreck. Its one of the [[Rovagug]] islands. They're raiders. They load the island with as much stuff as they can to sink the island to [[Rovagug]].
- This area was [[Voltaire]]'s ascension. He wont say when, But it was after he arrived on the island some weeks ago. 
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] asked if he met someone. [[Voltaire]] said the person he met says he looks like he bruises easily then hit him. He looks to the empty collar and sighs. "Bull headed creetin". he says. It had to have been in the last week. That's when he lost his last companion.
- [[Voltaire]] suggests we make out way to the Volusius estate.
- We leave.
### Two more hours to the Volusius Estate.
- Its far less busy than it was before. The lights are out.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], [[Victor Kasune|Victor]], and [[Voltaire]] hear a voice in their heads. Its the goddess.
- We see a seagull on the roof. Its [[Aurora]].
- We enter the estate and go to the goddess. "head my words and listen well, the populate has surrendered a devotion. this will call a stray divinity to the island. one that feeds on false hope, pain, and desperation."
- [[Voltaire]] wants food, water, wood to build. she says no.
- I hate her so much.
- [[Aurora]] enters and tried to push [[Voltaire]].
- She wants the goddess to take care of the prophet. She says no again.
- "You tell us no for everything we ask, what do you offer?" She offers us building supplies to build a ship.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] steps up. "Then we cant help. We cant fix her faith. You don't have any way to manage the fungus?"
- We are but 6 against hundreds.
- Goddess: "[[Aurora]], reach your hands into my soil." [[Aurora]] is hesitant. There's a box in there. It's a small box made of a green material. Its a molding for a key. Bring it to the bronze-smith and have the key made.
- She doesn't like the goddess, She is a goddess of Nature and the goddess inhibits it.
- in the Bronze-works is a massive man. 6 foot 2 and massive. We give him the key mold.
- He makes our key, Its done... ITS NOT THERE!
### [[Aurora]]
- [[Aurora]] is sitting in the field.
- "When the key is made it will get to you."
- As soon as the box opened, the key goes into the slot and opens.
- She digs down 200 feet.
### Back with us!
- The goddess tricked us. Damnit. [[Aurora]] tricked us!
- [[Voltaire]] storms off to confront the goddess, we follow.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] feel the rumbling from the fields. We turn to look towards the fields, Trees are growing! Raspberry bushes, Orchid bushes, Nature!
- [[Aurora]] crawls her way out of the ground glowing in light! she's burning. 7 flowers, one of each color of the rainbow bloom around her and siphons the burning. The abundance of positive energy is immense. The area is a beautiful sanctuary. 
- The goddess. "There is everything you have asked for, now save Citro."
- [[Aurora]] walks over. She looks as thought she was born again into the world. She turns into a bird and fly's into the thicket.
- We go back to [[The Grove Maiden]] to ask her where we can find [[Count Citro Volusius|the Count]].
- She is not there. [[Voltaire]] goes and starts beating in the Grove Guards. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] stop him. 
- I go and speak to [[Aurora]]. I tell her we can leave the island. She agrees to help us.
- She says that they can sense the others, but not distance or direction. She says there are two more pieces of power on this island.
- We go to the mine. We need to collapse the mine so it doesn't collapse the surrounding area too.
- We cant cave it in but we line the entrance with boulders.
- "Hey asshole! How'd you like the pit trap?" They learn words now.
- We decide to sleep. I take last watch.
## Sarenith 23, 2347 AE. 1am.
- My watch. The clearest night sky. I hear something messing with the tarp on the cave entrance.
- I wake [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] first, then others.
- Sounds of skittering.
- Small things, size of a dog. They're all small scorpions! It fucking had babies. Shit!
- I'm scared.
- I cast Blur on myself.
- We finally make it out alive!
- We cant stay here. We need to get to a safe place.
- We leave the estate and make our way to [[Voltaire]]'s Safehouse.
### Safehouse
- We continue sleeping. We wake around 10am.
- Son of a bitch... I'm infected. The spores have got to me.
- [[Aurora]] says she wont follow me if I am infected. She leaves.
- [[Voltaire]] chooses to join us. We decide to leave together and go to the school in hopes of a cure.
