# Journal
## Sarenith 24, 2347 AE. 
- The next morning.
- We need to get [[Count Citro Volusius|the Count]]. Why don't we use the Grove Guards? Because [[the Grove Maiden]] wont risk them.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] wants to go to [[Luke]]'s house. Not a bad idea.
- Where is the counts skiff? It WAS at the guard tower. that's gone and collapsed.
- First I suggest we go to the Counts first so we can get some food. THEN we can go to Lukes.
- Travel time. 6 hours.

### Volusius Estate
- We make it to the counts estate.
- The grove guards tell [[Voltaire]] he isn't allow to enter. He says he is there to tell [[the Grove Maiden]] an update of their mission.
- We try and speak to the goddess ourselves but she isn't showing herself. 
- Trying the Grove Guards again. They are chittering like monkeys. They go back to arguing.
- We go to the peasant area. [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] and [[Ember]] went there. Jacob is there. I give him back his wands and he lets me keep the sleep one.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] goes to speak with the guards to let him in.
- We go back to the goddess. [[Voltaire]] speaks to the urn and tells her the progress.
- We get food and decide to head out.
- Travel time. 8 hours- 28 miles from the Counts Estate to [[Luke]]'s.
- We arrive at 10pm.

### [[Luke]]'s
- The rocks are gone.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] thinks they were moved earlier today.
- We search the house. The entire place has been gutted. Everything of use is gone.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] searches and finds a hidden room in the bedroom.
- This room is gutted too but there are 4 large slabs.
- I see something that looks like alchemy formulas, I cant identify them.
- The slabs have fine sand and clay. There is some residual [[magic]]. There's a bit of Transmutation.
- We peek under one of the slabs. Underneath the slab is the red brick stone we found in all the trials.
- We decide to rest up for the evening.
- They try and spend more time to lift the slabs. Under each one is the red brick.

## Sarenith 25, 2347 AE.
- We wake up. 
- There are bugs? Fly's. There are a good dozen of them.
- I look at the writing again. He's making golems! I explain to the others what a golem is. He's probably making clay golems, and maybe sand golems.
- We follow the rocks and track it down underneath the island.
- We find [[Aurora]] near one of the holes. [[Luke]] left her. She's dejected.
- She says he fused the rocks into a stone golem.
- [[Aurora]] says he installed the [[Float Stones]] onto the stone golem.
- Auroras test was her and white haired man scorched her with the light of the gods.
- [[Luke]] is mythic but its wrong. He messed with all the trials. What if he has taken a piece of all our powers. Or he is forcing the last piece of power to his will.
- We hear a bit of buzzing. The Flies are [[Kyuss]]. He writes text in the air.
- "It would be a pity to call you apprentice, I declare you graduated" says [[Kyuss]].
- We ask about [[Luke]]. He is and was a madman but he seems more focused recently.
- What did he do the coin? Nothing, he couldn't touch it.
- We are not the first group of Mythic's. Heroes in the time. They are all here, because this is where they died.
- [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|The college]] was once a Colorion school of [[magic]]. Specifically Abjuration.
- The breaking took place over decades.
- [[Luke]] is heading to one of the wrecks. he has a long boat and all the monster crystals and float stones he could dig out. 
- "Well the answer is obvious, he's going to fuse them." That's a terrible idea. That will call the creature.
- We need to stop [[Luke]]. He is going to sink the island to kill the creature.
- [[Kyuss]] will get us a floatstone.
- [[Aurora]] tells us there are stuff in the cave.
- 500gp crystal dust
- 1BP worth of materials.
- We head back to the estate.
- Trip time. 8 hours.

### Volusius Estate
- Dinner time.
- We look for [[Voltaire]] and [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]].
- They're in the manor.
- Planning Session!
- We explain how [[Luke]] was a broken mythic.
- [[Voltaire]] says his was a Minotaur who he thinks someone else was there before.
- Victors wants him to kill someone. [[Luke]]?
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]]'s probably punched him. 
- Mine and Auroras were probably safe?
- There some beneath his house that has probably been siphoned.
- [[Voltaire]] says there is a new structure in [[New Haven]]. 
- Goals: Find [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]]. Find the last piece of power. Build transportation. Stop the hivemind. Kill the scorpion. Stop [[Luke]].
- [[Voltaire]] suggests [[Luke]] is lower priority.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] is gone. lol
- We go with [[Aurora]] to summon [[the Grove Maiden]].
- Can we have a boat to travel faster. She says no.
- We ask why. Because we will just leave.
- Can she give us means of faster transport. Her champion has awoken. the piece of power is also near her champion. in the center of the island.
- We need to go by the central hole at the bottom of the island.
- Can you command your followers to best assist us. You may use the talents of the bronze smith. We get food and water.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] asks about [[Luke]]. His name is Dimitri, not [[Luke]]. He is immortal and does not age, but if you cut him he will bleed.
- You with the nimble tongue, here's a potato. Please cry over the urn. lmao
