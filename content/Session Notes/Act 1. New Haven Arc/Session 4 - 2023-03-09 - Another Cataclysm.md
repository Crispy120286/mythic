# Log
## Sarenith 14, 2347 AE. 
I wake to professor [[Jacob Stevens]] color spraying me in the face. once my eyesight comes back he suggests I go get food from [[The Giving Hand]]. I get half a potato, a handful of peanuts, some turnip, handful of the white/green mushrooms.

I head down and get my daily rations. Upon returning to the school I realize I don't have a way to cook it. Hungry, I memorize my spells for the day.

I go to purchase a small cooking kit from [[The Dry Pencil]]. Upon returning I spot [[Victor Kasune|Victor]], He helps me carry my belongings and we head back to my room. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] was leaving the training spot. Asks if we want to go do something later. I don't even get a chance to respond before he runs off.

In my room I set up my new cooking kit. I cook my food. I use Prestidigitation to season my food and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]]'s mind is blown.

With [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]], we head out to meet with the Goddess.

He says its about a days walk from the City of [[New Haven]].

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] asks for us to take a detour. We head to Safehouse 7, as he calls it. We enter and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] introduces me to a woman. Its his mentor [[Cassius Morgan]]. He apparently has told this person a lot about me. 

We have a very long conversation about myself and my history as well as the history of [[Exypnos]]. She says the ring is about 3 years old. She asks so many questions. She is an information sponge.

##### [[Cassius Morgan]] has Goddess Questions.
How old are you?
How did you get here?
How are you summoned?

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] just wanted to walk to the nobles estate. I suggests that we use the Counts skiff. After our conversation we head back to the guardhouse. 

[[Count Citro Volusius|The Count]] isn't there. He says he went down to the Crows Nest. I cast Mage Armor.

We go to the Crows Nest. We hear combat ahead. 

### Combat
I rush forward and cast Mirror Image.

I get to the bar the next round and see three brutes attacking [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]]. I get in an aura, Hey! he's a paladin. 

I cast Flaming Arc into him "Kafsi kovotos". I get one in the face but the other dodges.
Rushing in I then cast Color Spray. We defeat the brutes.

[[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] takes the prisoners and we head back to the guard tower. [[Count Citro Volusius|The Count]] allows us to take the skiff to his estate.

##### The Counts Questions.
What dug the hole and how do we defend against it?
What are the strange new mushrooms?

We decide to head off tonight. [[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] tells us to ask for Octavia. 

The broken moon shines light as we approach the counts estate. We are shown a place to land outside the fields.

The countess approaches, She has red curly hair with green hair. She asks us what our business is and we let her know. She lets us in. 

We are led to where we are going to be sleeping for the night.

## Sarenith 15, 2347 AE.
##### The Next Morning.
We all wake in the morning.

We get our breakfast and watch the workers begin their prayers.

Countess Octavia comes out and will introduce us to the goddess. Loves potato's, hates mushrooms. To ask her questions we will have to do a service for her.

##### What questions should ask her.
1. What dug the hole and how do we defend against it?
2. What are the strange new mushrooms?
3. What happened to make you turn the island barren?
4. What can one do to fix it?
5. How old are you?
6. How did you get here?
7. How are you summoned?

The countess returns and gives us tea. I respectfully thank her.

She guides us to where the goddess is. We are led to a shrine room. The shrine holds a 3 foot round urn with rich black soil. The image on the urn are of rich green fields. The countess takes a small bit of water, plants a potato and waters it. A small green stalk begins to grow, a voice echo's inside of our heads.

"Hear me, I will answer your questions if you do i will answer your questions. Lenny's faith is acceptable, bring the potato to him and send him to the aquafer. the grove keepers will teach him the means of worship."

Question 1.  I don't know but I don't like it. I don't like when anything digs into my ground or soil. Its still there, but I can only see what's on the surface.

Question 2. She hates mushrooms. Destroy them, all of them.

Question 3. I starved out the predators. huge herbivores. She let them starve. 

Question 4. She says to remove her from the Island.

Question 6. The former count brought her here. the predators were causing trouble to [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|the college]]. She was brought here specifically do take out the predators.

Can we grow anywhere? Yes.

We ask our questions and get our answers. The countess digs up the potato and gives it to us to bring to Lenny. I didn't think the first time meeting a Deity would have been so dumb.

We sail back and give Lenny the potato and he runs on religious fervor to the aquafer.

We dock at the guard tower and meet [[Count Citro Volusius|the count]]. We debrief him on our questions.

### For Three Days
I am no longer being targeted by Professor Jacob
The other students attempt to haze me but I don't let them, I cast Create Pit and Web to trap them. 

## Serenith 20. 
###### The Great Announcement
The day begins with an auction!

Alaric auctions off how to smelt iron. 
someone offers 50 pounds of salt,
[[Count Citro Volusius|the count]] offers 100 pounds of worked bronze, 100 pounds of food, and 50 days of water.
A man with red armor and chained halflings, [[Voltaire]], offers a ton (2204 pounds) of salt that's 110,200gp worth of salt. and he offers another ton that he has only knowledge and no one ese will. He watches Alaric and no one else around him. Apparently he's missing a halfling. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] is concerned, they magically take damage for him. what could hurt him enough that would take out one of his halflings.

[[Ambros Moxley|The dean]] steps forward. I have an incredibly bad feeling. Something terrible is about to happen. 

[[Ambros Moxley|The dean]] calls the professors forward. This is a [[Float Stones]], it keeps the island a float. They're about to perform a ritual. They use the monster crystals and they use their power to go into the [[Float Stones]]. 

The ground breaks open! 
Out comes a massive colossal scorpion-like creature! Thirty feet wide and fifteen feet tall. Eight Sharp spiked covered legs with two massive front claws. Eight Eyes and a fanged maw. Coarse hair covers a single segment body with a massive poison barbed tail on the back. Spinnerets in the back.

It turns and breaths a white powdery substance on the crowd. the green and white mushrooms begin to grow upon them and they begin to attack those nearby them.

[[Zerg]] looks to be infected. He screams to run! 

We begin to run away as best as we can in the crowd.

[[Ambros Moxley|The Dean]] tries to attack the creature but its claw drives down and slays him. Its massive tail pierces Luna into the ground. [[Ember]] attacks with elements, Alaric throws bombs at it.

We continue evacuating with the crowd.
The hoard breaks into the central square.

The massive warship begins to attack the scorpion.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says we need to get to [[Luke]], he may have an idea of what is actually happening.

The scorpion jumps up into the ship and drags it to the ground.

It throws the ship to the guardtower and it is destroyed.

We head to the walls.

The creature takes the floatstone, and heads down deep into the ground.

We make it out. We head towards [[Luke]]'s.

###### Current Goals
- [ ] stuff

## The Prophet (DM NOTES)

A Colossal spider-scorpion hybrid. Thirty feet wide and fifteen feet tall. Eight Sharp spiked covered legs with two massive front claws. Eight Eyes and a fanged maw. Coarse hair covers a single segment body with a massive poison barbed tail on the back. Spinnerets in the back.

Brown and black.

-   Round 1: The ground bulges and buckles upward, crumbling nearby buildings as two barb covered claws emerge from the ground. Bodies fly, people scatter, The thing emerges in it's horrific glory. Chitinous legs driving down into the stone like it was made of mud, Stomping and crushing heading towards the school. It lets out a cone of white powder onto the crowd.  

-   Round 2: The People scream and claw at their exposed skin, white green mushrooms begin to grow from their clothing as their veins slowly turn green under their skin, The screaming stops as a moss-like substance grows out of their ears and mouth. They leap onto the people nearby and latch on or drag down, trying force the moss and mushrooms into the poor soul's mouth and open wounds.  
    The Mages go on the offensive, fireballs leave it unharmed. Lightning grounds down along it’s shell into the ground. Magic Missles fizzle against the things plated armor. It charges towards them trampling over the crowd of people paying no heed to what's in it's way. [[Ambros Moxley|The Dean]] charges to meet the thing, his defensive abjurations graying his skin, creating shimmering blurring copies of himself. Jacob putting a displacement on him and moving to evacuate the students.  
    The remaining guards work on crowd control. Filtering people away from the slowly growing mass of wild men and women before being overwhelmed. [[Zerg]] dragging the PC's away before the growing infection begins to manifest. Looking at his arm and the green veins forming he shakes his head, staying behind to hold off the throng, going into rage and weiding his double axe, hacking as the mob runs over him, kicking one off and slamming another's head into the ground before getting jumped on by three others. The Pcs get another round to escape and hide.  
    
-   Round 3: [[Ambros Moxley|The Dean]] gets snatched up and squeezed in a massive claw that brings him towards it's maw. [[Ambros Moxley|The Dean]]'s fist glows a sickly green and he punches it in the mouth, causing one of it's fangs to disintegrate into nothing. It hurls him to the ground and raises one massive leg and stomps down on [[Ambros Moxley|the dean]] again and again, leaving only a hole coated in red paste behind. The tail drives down into Luna and pins her as she screams, hands clutching the wound. Summoned monsters attempting to fruitlessly free her.  
    The Warship disengages from the docks, it's mooring lines snapping as it begins it's slow turn to engage the thing from the air.  
    
-               Round 4: The Guards engage the horde in a fighting retreat, letting them stumble and claw over each other, striking at the edges but not doing much to slow it. Maybe a few hundred infected as the berserkers leave wounded alone and groaning on the ground.  
    The Warship flies towards the Prophet. [[Ember]] blasts the thing over and over, small cracks forming in the thing's natural armor. Luna twitches and goes limp, her summoned monsters vanishing. Alaric emerges from the school and mixes bombs in clay urns, throwing a sticky tar like explosive at it's legs, trying to glue it down. The monster screeches and pulls up stone and dirt with it's legs, but it is walking noticeably slower.  
    
-                Round 5: The guards arrive at the square. They demand people move their carts, stalls, and anything else to the roadway to form a barricade. The Horde advances more quickly spilling in as the makeshift barrier's construction begins. More Panic and mob mentality.  
    The Prophet pushes forward, claws push into the school and it drives it's head into the main entrance where Alaric and [[Ember]] stand, caving in the front over and on top of it, the pincer tail swiping around, Luna's body flies off somewhere over the wall. The Warship lights it's pitch as it gets into range. The crew keeping up 150ft from it.  
    
-                Round 6: The Horde pushes into the square, thinning out into the larger space. Individual visitors and residents taking up arms, it breaks down into smaller skirmishes. (Fight two infected)  
    The Warship launches Pitch at the thing's exposed back, igniting the white powder covering it's shell, it pushes up over the roof of the school tail poised. The next volley of pitch misses and causes it to raise up on it's front legs looking up at the ship.  
    
-                Round 7: The Warship drops a volley of Cluster bombs from a bottom hatch, exploding around it, kicking up dust and white powder, flickers of flame rising up. The Thing Leaps and latches onto the bottom of the Warship. Spiked legs digging into the iron hull and clinging on, tail driving into the back of the ship. Dragging it down as the crew screams.  
    The Square begins to fall as more of the horde pours in. Now stray members are moving into the permanent houses and structures. The Theatre is invaded.  
    
- Round 8: Citro calls for any remaining guards to filter people up the walls and into tighter spaces. The few remaining guards try but it's anarchy and their commands are unheeded. Combat continues.  
	The Prophet rips the hull apart and begins to feast on the crew, pulling them out with massive pincers and shoveling them into it's maw with the sounds of screeching metal, screams, and breaking bones heard.  
 
- Round 9: Prophet eats and looks to the school, hurling the destroyed warship at the docks, collapsing the top half. The square is holding on but barely, the remaining horde having left injured and broken behind, moving about in smaller numbers in a freakishly coordinated attack on the onlookers and stragglers.The remaining crowd scatters to save themselves.  
- Round 10: The Monster heads into the school slowly, clearly badly wounded, it burrows down into the library, the gravity of the island shifts.
