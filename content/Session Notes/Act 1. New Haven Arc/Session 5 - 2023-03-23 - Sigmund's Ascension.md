# Log
## Sarenith 20, 2347 AE. (Continued)
- Running away!
- We stop to rest for a bit. There are tracks in the sand.
- We make it to [[Luke]]'s in a few more hours.
- There's an elf in his house. She calls herself [[Aurora]]. She has longer ears than a normal elf. Says [[Luke]] wasn't here when she got here.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] search the building.
- I assist [[Aurora]] in potion crafting. Spellcraft 15.
- We rest at [[Luke]]'s. Time-skip!!

##### Evening.
- We hear someone clinking along in metal armor. He calls in asking for [[Luke]].
- [[Voltaire]] enters, along with his 3 halflings. He is a big man in red plate armor. About 6 foot, well build. We don't see weapons or a shield on his person. His halfling slaves are better dressed and equipped than us. They have steel weapons. He sits down at the table. He speaks oddly proper.
- We discuss the current events.
- He proposes a truce. He will go to the Volusius estate. We are to go to the city.
- He takes his helmet off, He is an attractive human male.
- He suggests we meet up at the aqueduct between the city and the estate.
- During the night we see his halfling leave for an hour and return.

## Sarenith 21, 2347 AE.
- I prepare my spells in the alchemy room with [[Aurora]].
- [[Voltaire]] is already gone.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] has potato's!
- [[Aurora]] joins us for breakfast.
- She can create water!
- We leave [[Luke]]'s place and head back towards the city. It takes about 8 hours.

### City of [[New Haven]].
- We are in sight of the city walls. There are people spread out about 20 feet apart.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and [[Aurora]] head off to scout.
- They come back and there are 2 possible ways to enter. By the aqueduct, or the hole by the Crows bar.
- We decide to go to the Crows Bar entrance. We move around about an hour. As we get close to the wall. About 65% of the way there, we see the people. They have blue fuzz coming from their ears. In unison they all look down at the same exact time and some jump off the wall and run towards up. RUN! There's about 4 of them.
- [[Aurora]] turns into a wolf and tried to round them up. They get about 100 feet from us but they turn back to the town. Are they a hivemind?
- We rush towards the entrance. 
##### Combat
- the infected come up to intercept us. I ready a spell.
- The enemies get within 130 feet of us and I create pit underneath them and 3 drop in. 
- We go around outside them and manage to get into the city.
##### City
- We get inside and shake off the zombies.
- We go around the town and try and make our way to the guard tower.
- We are being watched. Its the towns people.
- We make our way to the guard tower and its mostly destroyed. Shuffling feet behind us.
- RUN! 
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] falls behind. I cast Web behind us to block them off.
- We get to one of Victors safehouse.
- We jump across some roofs and climb down [[The Giving Hand]].
- We get to the guard tower and get ourselves down into the evidence room of the guard tower. The zombies follow us and try to trap us in. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] picks the lock and gets us into the evidence room.
### Guard Tower Dungeon
- Inside the door is being banged on by the zombies outside.
- We go west.
-  Our feet echo and the air is dry.
- We see 3 men in leather armor. Barnabus, Jeriah, and Seth. They say they are the last 3 down from 10. They say they have some food and water for us.
- They bring us to a make shift camp.
- We discuss the current situation with the zombies. Hive Mind? [[Zerg]] is down here. This is 4 rings of dungeons.
- There is about 2 days of food left.
- The next ring is a labyrinth. It was designed to hold things within. It was here before the breaking.
-  We rest up.

## Sarenith 22, 2347 AE.
- We wake the next morning underground and prepare spells.
- The doors into the other rings auto-lock when we get into them.
- I pull out a sheet of parchment and plan on writing a map of the labyrinth when we're down.
- [[Aurora]] creates 3 more potions but keeps them and creates water for everyone. We go forward, deeper into the dungeon.
### The Second Ring.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] picks the lock and we enter.
- We hear foot falls and something dragging. We think its [[Zerg]].
- Sneaky attempt! We think they're onto us.
- We round a corner and see two of the zombies.
- We defeat them.
- There are the sounds of footfalls, they're coming for us.
- We find the door thanks to [[Aurora]]! Dugeoneering 29
### The Third Ring
- The door closes... and we hear a loud roar from within.
- We're in a 20x20 foot room. It was burnt out. Everything is old and rotten. Most decayed and some recently wrecked. 
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] chooses the north door.
- This room has a smooth floor with a conjuration circle. its cracked and broken. Husks of insects.
- Next room another burnt out laboratory. Another major door! The door has the key inside.
- We open it.
### The Fourth Ring
- This is a storage room. an actual room.
- So much food.
- Center of the room is an iron chest. chain wrapped around and a padlock.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] opens the chest.
- Inside is a single bladed steel greataxe. The handle is a spine, like a body spine, its loose and curved around. strange...
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] touches it. He is engulfed in fire!!

### [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]].
- He is in a white room with heavy objects. Off to the side is a short thing with blue hair lifting a boulder. It has iron hands.
- You're here to Fuck with [[Rovagug]]! It grabs him and power surges through him.
- He can feel the power pulsing through him. The power pours out of him as fire.

### Back in the real world.
- The fire moves to the axe and the haft is rigid. 
- There is more pieces on the island.
- There is one other on the island who has it. [[Voltaire]]. His heart is now made of adamantine.
- [[Zerg]] breaks through.
- We battle him. 
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] defeats him. "[[Zerg]], you've done way too much for me to let you suffer. I'm sorry."
- He kills him.
