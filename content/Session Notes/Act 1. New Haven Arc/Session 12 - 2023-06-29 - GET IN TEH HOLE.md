# Journal
## The day of Reckoning. Sarenith 30, 2347 AE.
-  Siege Weaponry! That's the plan!
- We each get a two days worth of rations.
- We go down the hole. [[Voltaire]] falls and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] carries [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]].
- The hole is a sand cave with many side chambers.
- We continue onward for over an hour and find another hole.
- we continue onward at the bottom and... we find another hole.
- Unsure what to do next. we re-plan. The hole is deep and we're not sure how we can get the creature up from down here.
- Another hole! 400 feet this time. We're even further into the island. The same yellow grey stone makes up the ground. We're into the rocky core of the island. Damp and smells like fermented fungus. ew.
- We see what was making the chambers. We see a slightly mucous like slime. We see more larger Scorpider holes in the chamber walls. Mercifully something is giving air circulation in this chamber.
- We slowly make our ways forward. The ground is slick. Everyone but [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and [[Aurora]] fall into the goo.
- The goo is slightly tingly on the skin and makes it red. Its almost impossible to remove.
- Eventually the chamber opens up.
>[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]]. "I'm a dwarf, I have a lower center of gravity!" He says right before he falls.
- The Scorpiders here stay out from underfoot. We see piles of fungi and fresh "food". See dead townsfolk in piles. We see new fungi and dead townsfolk being placed on the piles.
- I cast detect [[magic]] on the piles. I find a couple of auras. I find a pair of wands and a single potion. One wand is Create Water (32), One wand of Protection from Chaos (24), Potion of reduce Person.
- We continue downward. The next chamber, We cannot see the ceiling. Now our feet are sticking to the floor. The Mucous is sticky when it dries. We see 2 foot tall eggs. We see one hatch and diminutive Scorpiders fall and skitter into holes.
- We stare in horror... 
- We look for a way forward. After 30 minutes of searching we are not sure of our way forward. We need to go down into one of the smaller slimy Scorpider holes.
- One of the nanny bugs climbs up [[Voltaire]]'s leg and I flick it off.
- [[Aurora]] turns into a dire badger and begins digging a larger hole for us. It takes her around 30 minutes. We make our way in the new hold downward. 
- I memorize fly and [[Aurora]] and I investigate the lower area. We get about 1,800 ft. and we have to turn back.
- Its at this point that we turn back and go back to the surface. We go back to the [[Voltaire]] Estate.
- [[Voltaire]] commissions 1,000 ft. of rope and some copper pitons.
- I want to try and find [[Aurora]]. I have a theory about searching for the Mythic Powers.
- [[Aurora]] gave the last of her Mythic power to [[The Grove Maiden]] to extend her protection to [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]].

## Erastus 1, 2347 AE.
- We all wake and prepare.
- [[The Grove Maiden]] speaks into our heads. She calls us forward to discuss something. We go.
- I meditate on the Mythic power and fail on sensing more. the power is there.
- We have climbers kits!

## Erastus 2, 2347 AE.
- We go back to the hole. Placing the potato's they grow vines and connect together.
- We dig back in the hole and we see [[Count Citro Volusius|the Count]] down there. and [[Adeline Wolfe]].
- There are about 6 infected there and they're trying to water and feed the prisoners.
- [[Count Citro Volusius|The count]] was taken on Sarenith the 15th. Its been 17 days.
- We enter the chamber and the infected move off to the side. 
- Citro and Adeline leave the cave. 

### Red Brick Tunnel
- We continue onward and find ourselves in a tunnel lined with red bricks. Suspended in the air is the [[Float Stones]]. A robed figure below with as snapped staff and a dagger in its back.
- We see the massive Scorpider appear. Scary... The Prophet of the Hivemind.
- This thing can not be killed. We are not prepared...
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] charges and nearly dies.
- The monk grabs him and runs
- We all run to escape
- The Goddess appears.
>you need to learn to prepare better. - Archmage.
- We run! It follows. It can burrow through the earth!
- We get to the mushroom room. The monk follows.
- Hawk screeches in the distance. [[Aurora]] found the exit!
