# Journal
## Erastus the 15th.
- We're at the bottom. I sink down to my knees after taking a step forward.
- Walk forward to a viney tree. We stand on its roots and out of the muck.
- We all discuss if we continue or not.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] scouts ahead and gets lost but comes back a bit later.
- We decide to rest here, I cast Rope Trick. We go up it and rest.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] asks about magic. 
- I talk about my past and asks if they believe me or not.

## Erastus the 16th.
>Not a dream, but an awareness. We caught somethings attention. We done know how or when. But its aware of us. Its fleeting. Doesn't pay us mind for very long. Something despondent, something rotting, something with nothing to lose.
- I wake and prepare my spells.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and [[Aurora]] scout.
- Theres a structure in the distance. we go explore it. 
- I cast Fly and [[Aurora]] cast anthaul on me.
- The dome has a slimy ooze monster thing.
- we heal.
- There are footprints below
- There's a being. creepy.
- Its a construct being.
- [[Stray Deity of Loss and Decay]]
- I ask it what it is, it says it is the God of this place.
- It formed from the loss and decay of this place and manifested.
