# Journal
## Sarenith 23, 2347 AE. Morning.
- I am infected. The noise isn't loud or abrasive. but its there. Its like a thought I'm trying to remember but I cant grasp. Its maddening.
- We head towards the city. Its 4 hours away. [[Voltaire]], [[Victor Kasune|Victor]], [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], and Myself. We leave [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] and one of [[Voltaire]] halflings behind. 
- I am feeling worse.
- A voice that isn't my own speaks in my head. "How whole?" I am feeling awful. 
- We get to the city. It seems more empty.
- The school is about 30 minutes away. We get there without incident.

### [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|The college]]
- [[New Haven's College of Arcane Studies|The college]] is covered in red mushrooms that puff spores.
- There is the hole that the creature made. Some buildings are still standing.
- The voice speaks again. "How whole? How whole?"
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] asks where the float stones are? I suggest unground.
- They say I have to stay back as they go into the mushroom fields. 
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] lifts the rubble and finds [[Ember]]!
- She is infected and looking bad.
- I am trying to keep my mind by reciting the prime numbers and pi.
- We decide to go to the Deans office, maybe he has a contingency to get underground.
- There are spider scorpion things are watching us.
- The Deans quarters and some labs are still accessible.
- The Deans office, [[Kyuss]]' office, and Jacob's office.
- We go to the Deans first. Everything is smashed, crushes, and yanked apart. Looks like an angry mob rolled through here.
- I am more infected... shit
- [[Kyuss]]' room was tilled and there's an open hole. there are footprints. There's a coffin in the floor. Covering a hole. The hole is 100 feet down.
- The voice compels me to tell it how I create pit. (Will save 9= Fail). I begin reciting exactly how to cast Create Pit.
- [[Voltaire]] lowers his halflings into the hole. There are 2 doors.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] carries me and climbs down [[Voltaire]]'s Chain.
- We're at the bottom of the pit and there are two doors. 
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] tells me to pick, I do so. "Good choice". I change my mind. "Better choice"
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] opens the door. 
- This room has thick carpets and sofas. Its very comfortable. Behind the curtains there's a image of outside. Gentle plains and trees and birds. 
- The entire room has a mild preservation enchantment on it. Nothing in this room will ever decay.
- We check the other door.
- The first thing we notice in the next room is a stove. This room is a kitchen stocked with plenty of cooking supplies and food. It is staffed by Unseen Servants.
- The next room is a cozy study. It smells of books. The voice in my head wants me to open it. 
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] drags us to the next room. There's another summoning circle. 
- It keeps talking to me.
- It wants me to investigate the summoning circle bit I don't let it. I leave.
- The next room looks to be a laboratory. There's a table with lab equipment. There's various  magic items in different stages of completion. Unseen Servants are cleaning.
- I look for a cure... I find two blank spell books and scribing supplies! (not a cure)
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] goes to the next room. Its a meeting room. There are windows with light coming through. There are pitchers with cool fresh water. The windows are of a forest.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] wants to live in the forest.
- Next room! A dome roof, there are star charts. a massive telescope in the center.
- Detect magic. Telescope is magical. It can follow the same spot in the sky. Other magic items better track and scribe star charts.
- The star chart represents what they SHOULD look like today.
- I need to find home! [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] drags me away from star charts.
- Next room! Hallway with a door at the end and one in the middle.
- The last door is of ancient oak with dials, its a room with a controllable biome! Its all an illusion. The center is a comfortable chair.
- The last door is a room for music, a stage and comfortable chairs.
- In the back is a door.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] opens it. The door is a jumble of words. This area isn't a prison but it is a place of learning. I don't need to study or learn, I know this lock. Its written in Old Empire. I put in the code.
- "The pursuit of knowledge is all in itself rewarding".
- The central chamber is cold. frigidly cold. Its covered in frost. A center pillar surrounded by 8 corpses.

### Recording
- Magical writing. It is [[Kyuss]]. 
- What is this place? There is a Ancient Empire coin made by an Ancient Wizard to give them his power. 
- The bodies are new, The other "trials" didn't have bodies.
- Torag fell into its maw. Irori died. Shaelyn was so wounded that the scars never healed. Lesser beings dead to [[Rovagug|the rough beast]]. 
- This room is square. I walk around it.
- "you should touch it, don't you desire power?" 
- I never desired power.
- I examine the pillar.
- I examine the coin. Its mint number is 00000000. 
- I ask [[Kyuss]] who he is? He made a vile choice that drove away his companions. He was around before the cataclysm. 
- I ask Ioun. It doesn't know what to do. 
- I touch the coin.

### [[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] touches the coin.
- I find myself in the middle of a rushing river.
- I see a man dressed in regal blue.
- I am being admonished.
- I know this man. I met him once. My father introduced me.
- Middle age elf.
- Archmage of the empire. He makes no effort to hide is displeasure.
- I look back, I can see myself back and back and back. all my actions. Days ago.
- Every time I failed to choose for myself. the river got wider.
- This is the river of my indecision.
- [[Kyuss]] words echo. "At least I made a choice. you were told."
- Archmage says he should give his power to [[Kyuss]].
- He says I am always worse choice.
- He offers me a choice. I reach for his hand and grab his hand.
- I see far in the future. different possibilities.
- the river was only stiffing me, 

>"I am [[Caeris Colorion|Caeris]] Colorion, Archmage, I will not be defeated. I will fight for my destiny, and I will emerge victorious"

- The room begins to fade. The protective enchantment begins to fade.
