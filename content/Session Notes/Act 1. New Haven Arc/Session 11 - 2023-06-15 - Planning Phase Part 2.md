# Journal
## Sarenith 25, 2347 AE.
- We have a metalsmith. We have spellcasters ([[Ember]] and Jacob). We have an Alchemist ([[Aurora]]).
- The prophet awaits in the depths.
- Most immediate problems: The Scorpider. 
- I need to invent rope. Need to get the metalsmith to get spearhooks to spear the Scorpider. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and [[Aurora]] going to [[New Haven]] to search Voltaires ship. [[Voltaire]] and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] are going to look into the mines for clay.
- Problems: At least a week to set all this up.
- We go speak to Jacob and tell him our plans.
- I then go and look for people to help make rope and fail.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Voltaire]] see more fungus underground. they pile MORE rocks onto it.
- I then decide to  check with the metalsmith and see [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] who is getting him to make something.
- [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] helps me gather people to help make rope.
- We all perform a ritual to pray to [[The Grove Maiden]]. we plan potatoes and get lots of vines!

### Montage! day 1.
- We have lots of rope with the vines.
- I spend the time making schematics for the siege engines.
- [[Victor Kasune|Victor]], [[Aurora]], and Jacob loot the ship in the city. for 1BP
	- 10 steel ballista heads.
	- 3 bundles of flaming pitch.
	- Misc tools.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] loots 750gp of materials.
### Montage! day 2
- Plans on making siege engines. 4 Ballista and 4 Catapult. 
- Catapult requires 4 people to man, the Ballista requires 1. I recommend doubling up. so a total of 40 people to man the siege engines.
- We decide to set up the siege engines a good distance away so the people dont get hit with the spores.
- [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] go to Lukes.
- [[Luke]] is there! He is crazy.
### Montage! day 3
- I make homefries!
- Meeting with the Mythics.
- [[Luke]] has multiple personalities.
- Spores burn, the Scorpider hates cold. We need to burn the spore tower.
- After much arguing we go speak to [[The Grove Maiden]].

### Grove Maiden
- Can we drop a blizzard on the city? With daily help, yes.
- How long has that thing been on the island? Longer than I. Its been feeding on the fauna. Without food it went into hibernation.
- Did [[Rovagug]] spit minions into its hole to feed it? I don't know for certain but the last attack was smaller than usual.
- Did [[Rovagug]] attacked the island since the 9th? Not that I noticed but it is overdue.
- When we go through the plan to launch it from the island, can you help with cold? Reinforced yes. There is a deity.
- Hivemind? Goddess knows, She is getting prayers more than ever before.
### Montage!
- [[[[The Grove Maiden]]|[[The grove maid]]en]] sets a blizzard upon the city.
- Lightning strike upon the spire. HA!

## The day of Reckoning. Sarenith 30, 2347 AE.
- Here we are.
