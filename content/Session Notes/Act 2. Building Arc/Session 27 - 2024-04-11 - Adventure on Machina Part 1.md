## Erastus 8, 2348. Week 48 [[Gnostis]]
%%Notes go here%%
4 weeks of stuff. Working on my Island. (Add notes Here)

Week 44, 45, 46, 47
I leave on week 48.

I get a message from Victor.
I put Lysander in charge while I am gone.

It takes me a day to get there.

## Erastus 9, 2348, Week 48. [[Macina]]
Macina Island has long golden fields of wheat. They figured out how to turn it into textile. They have Cloth. Trader [[Devian Nightstrider]] came through recently. Had some intricate tapestries made by [[Lysandra Duskfall]]. They have paintings which means they have pigments on this island as well made [[Elysia Starlight]]. Her paintings made of Starlit skies and creepy figures in the distance. In addition they have successful goat and pig farm.

Island has a dilapidated mine and a hell knight barracks.

I make my way to the tavern. I see Sigmund, Victor, and Orist.

Ooh bacon!

We get the mission from Victor and Orist. There are Warforged on this island. They are concerned there is a Genesis Chamber somewhere on this island.

We go and question the Musician.

They were here since they left [[Nidal]]. An old nation from the age of Darkness. They are Kayal (Fletchlings). Their Dark Lord Zon Kuthon keeps their island in perpetual night. There is religious tension there between them and Pharasma. 

We go and speak to [[Thorne Shadowsong]].

On our way we meet 4 Kayal. Orist talks to them and they escort us.

They take us to a building and they just let us in. [[Liora Shadowleaf]], a fortune teller. Throne has a workshop. He makes contraptions, toys he calls them. Victor asks about Human Sized constructs. He would "kill" to get a facility to make human sized constructs.

Orist asks if we can see the workshop. Its covered in darkness... I cant see anything. Sigmund leads me. 

The tech left here he could build upon it, make it better. It is a passion project. He pulls out an adamantine spherical machine and it radiates 5 feet of Darkness. An Adamantine square machine radiates 20 feet of darkness, but this one needs to be recharged, the sphere never needs recharging.

Will the hell knights come out of their keep for their tributes? 

We try and speak to [[Ryland]] but he doesn't answer his door.

We go back to the tavern and goes to bed.

## Erastus 10, 2348. Week 48. [[Macina]]
We are woken up in the morning by knocking on the door. [[Ryland]] wants to speak to us. Appearently the entire population of Goldleaf is missing.

We go speak to him. He has a big sword on his back. He very angry and accuses us of making an entire village go missing. he left.
