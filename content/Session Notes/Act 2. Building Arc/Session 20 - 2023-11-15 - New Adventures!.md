# Journal
## A few weeks into the journey

A few weeks into the journey, the crack on [[Mythoros]] has been a bit uneasy, It is completely wrapped around it. Less prone to his normal interactions and its not listening to me when I say its time to translate. It stopped and slowly splits in half. I am startled and reach for it.

Inside was a tiny calligraphy wyrm.  It stretches up and flies into my pocket. The Ioun stones follow it. 

Mythoros says he was placed into the cabin on purpose. that he was manufactured or born. He remembers everything from [[New Haven]]. He says he can continue his translation duties.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] begins to scout the island.
