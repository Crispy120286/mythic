# Journal
## Gozran 30, 2348. Week 38, [[Thordun]]
We're all alive and mostly whole.
We hear the drums. The [[Stray Deity of War and Strategy]] is on its way. Oh crap.

We see [[Keeg]], It begins to guide us out but a hobgoblin arm reaches in a grabs him by the back of the neck and drags him out of the tunnel.

The way ahead is blocked. We hear Hobgoblin speaking. We see the tip of a long spear with a red bandana tied around it. A grizzled old hobgoblin leans down and peeks into the hole. He wears ornate armor with a romans general helmet. Its the [[Stray Deity of War and Strategy]].

[[Voltaire]] in the lead. We head thru the slave tunnels and find ourself at a crossroads, We see 6 Hobgoblins to our right. I cast Obscuring mist and we escape to the let. Another 10 minutes of running We arrive at a room with small firelight.

We see a war room and a venerable Hobgoblin stands there dressed in roman general armor. He appears to be over a map of the complex and is leading pieces down hallways towards this very room. He looks to [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and shakes his head disappointedly. The venerable hobgoblin asks [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] to step forward and asks why he is here.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] responds he is here to commandeer the fortress, he isn't here to trade for it.

He removes the map and tokens and lays down another map. It looks to be a map of the surrounding islands. More forces and other ships on it.

He doesn't want to lose any more troops, he already lost two commanders. 

He wants War. There is war several systems away between Iomedae and Gorum. He is bound to the island and can not leave. He is tied to the [[Float Stones]].

We need to offer him the troops and a ship so he can leave the island but he cannot order the [[Order of the Nail|hellknights]] to give it to him.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] is considering giving the [[Stray Deity of War and Strategy]] his own ship, and its 20 crew, plus the 50 slaves that [[Voltaire]] gave him for this mission.

The deal is struck. The contract is signed. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] gives his own warship for the cause and takes Sigmunds Sailing ship.

### Evacuation
The evacuation takes place over three days.

On the first day, I cast Scrying on [[Keeg]] to see how he is doing. [[Keeg]] is currently chained in one of the small chambers, his feet are dangled. his mouth is tied closed with cord. The [[Order of the Nail|hellknights]] are cutting his arms and packing the wounds with strange powder. He's being tortured badly.

[[Voltaire]] walks up to the [[Order of the Nail|Hellknights]] outside and speaks to them in Bugbear. The offer one hand and a testicle for free.

[[Voltaire]] intimidates the [[Order of the Nail|hellknights]]. They promise to stop torturing [[Keeg]].

## Desnus 2, 2348
The [[Order of the Nail|Hellknights]] leave. I finish a glorious game of chess with the deity.

We go outside and meet at the rendezvous point for our ships.

They left most of the structure outside as the [[Order of the Nail|hellknights]] left.

Voltaires ship arrives. He says our business is concluded. He will send our ships here.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] goes and checks on [[Keeg]].

I make sure the contract is fulfilled and the crew and slaves are on their rightful ships. Sigmunds crew is mostly okay with this new ships owner.

The Local Deity relinquishes ownership of the island.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] clams ownership of the island He levels up and gains a mythic rank.

the now stray deity leaves the island. He laughs in liberation as the ship sails onward.
