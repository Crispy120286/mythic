# Journal
## Erastus 11, 2348. Week 48. [[Macina]]
[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] reads the edgy poem. 

There is a hatch embedded into the ceiling.  We climb out and exit out the big dumb boring tree. nothing to this tree at all. [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] is insisting there's something special about it.

We walk back to [[Goldenleaf]]. The city that everyone vanished from. From there we head to [[Quartz Cove]]. We go to [[Ryland]]'s house. Hes resting. [[Talia Nightshade]] is tending to him. She looks at us suspiciously and leaves.

He says that about three hours ago some people went crazy. They spoke in 1's and 0's and attacked others. They managed to subdue them and put them into prison.

Tomorrow is Hell Knight tribute day. (Assholes)

I go to [[Silvershade]] and Aldrics Tavern has Tea. Its delicious! I buy 10 pounds worth for 2 pounds of Salt.

## Erastus 12, 2348. Week 48. [[Macina]]
I head to the Genesis Chamber. Dont need to go through the tree way, its dumb and boring. AH CRAP TRAPS!

 Meanwhile [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] and [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] are watching the tribute.

I make my way to the Genesis Chamber

I study it. I net a total of 74 DC. I can figure out how to uncorrupt it. The runes aren't changing but they're layered. 

The corruption is: the subject with a soul is fed into it and they become a follower of [[Rovagug]]. There's an exception for its own creation. Another thing I notice is the wards so set prevent anyone divine or otherwise from claiming the island. Its not just caved into the chamber, its into the energy surrounding it. That just needs to be slowly erased.

I spend another week here cleansing the wards on the chamber.

One of the days Aldric pops in. He offers us some pocket bacon. Odd?

## Erastus 19, 2348. Week 49. [[Macina]]
I finish removing the wards. [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] gives me 1BP for helping.

I leave and head back home.

## later
It starts off slow.

I notice a new star in the sky. It's pink in color. I have a terrible feeling about that star. Something is terribly wrong with it.

The very next night, it gets bigger

It gets bigger every day.

In a weeks time i gets into orbit and begins circling the sky.

> Positive energy effects become more potent, 
> Negative enetfy effects are dminished
> Once barren islands begin to recovery their natural growth in the form of wild edibles and native plant life.
> All islands gains ..... Gets notes from Geoff.

When it begins circling the sky. Living beings in the glow are heartier, faster, and mature more quickly.

Then the star falls towards [[Rovagug]].

Then the world shakes as the battle between the thing and [[Rovagug]]  lasts for a week.
