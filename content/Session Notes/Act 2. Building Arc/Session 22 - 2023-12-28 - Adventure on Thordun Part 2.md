# Journal
## Gozran 30, 2348. Week 38, [[Thordun]]
I send [[Lysander Ravensong|Lysander]] back to the ship.

We crawl our way into the crack in the mountain. Its slow going. At the end I cast Innocuous Shape on [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] to sneak ahead. He finds a slave quarters full of Ratfolk and Goblins. He comes back and disguises himself as a Hobgoblin again and we walk forward. [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] pretends to be a slaver and tells the slaves to act their best behavior. We move onward and find ourselves at a branching path. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] chooses the right path. More tunnels that move up and around.

I guess there are probably 8 or so chambers in the area.

The slaves are well treated and clean, their bedding is washed.

Combat with 2 [[Order of the Nail|Hellknights]].

Meet kobold. his name is [[Keeg]]. He tells us about the island and its inhabitants. He appears to enjoy being a slave.

There are 3 ships. There are 3 leaders. One ship and leader is out.

Leaders:
Master of Blades- [[Raz'gar Gugbane]] (Level 12 something??)
[[Sarvina Flamebrand|Paravicar]]- [[Sarvina Flamebrand]] (Level 10 Godclaw Oracle) (Off Island right now)
[[Grendok Mok'bara|Paralictor]]- [[Grendok Mok'bara]] (Level 10 Bard)

[[Stray Deity of War and Strategy]], We don't know much about it or its name.

Keeg recommend we kill the leaders and all but 1 ship. the rest will run.

He is going to bring us as close as he can to the Master of Blades as he can.
