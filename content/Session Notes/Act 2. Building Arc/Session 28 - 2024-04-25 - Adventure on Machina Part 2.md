## Erastus 10, 2348. Week 48. [[Macina]]
%%Notes go here%%
Recap. Strange robotic beings on the island.  The entire village of Goldenleaf has gone missing. We're currently in Silvershade. 

The island is blanketed in tall swaying yellow crasses. Small rivers cris-crossing with boats. Its nearly always overcast. The sun casts a pale yellow light.

The tavernkeep [[Aldrick Shadowstride]] says he is sorry about [[Ryland]]'s treatment of us.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] asks [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] about "Real people" and why we can see some people better than others. 

We leave [[Silvershade]] and fly off. We land and tie off our skiff in [[Goldenleaf]]. 

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] finds a potential trail. Its full of annoying buggies. The grass doesnt make a good trail. The grass is a rubbery noodle thing. Not a blade like normal grass grass.

We track them to an area we think they are. Then the trail goes cold.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] and [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] are curious about the weird grass. Its mostly harmless.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]]'s patron contacts Auroras on the weird grass. She calls it Hags Hair. [[Aurora]] wants some.

Someone is singing a creepy song while sitting in a tree. [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] responds with his own emo poem. 

We head back to Goldenleaf. 

We search the city again. We need to do a concentrated search effort. I manage to trick [[Ryland]] into helping us with a clever bluff check. It takes a bit more searching.

Nearly impossible to see under regular circumstances, we find one set of footprints that came from [[Stonewind]]. This one sunk a little bit deeper into the dirt. This person was a bit heavier.

We search for [[Raven Shadowclaw]]s house. We find [[Luna Moondreamer]].  

We knock on Ravens house. No answer. There is a stirring inside of the building and some quiet whispering. Its in binary.

Orist smiles and Luna faints. Someone gives him flowers. Raven finally opens the door and he says "I couldn't help but noticing you from afar, this is for you." He hands her the flowers. She invites us in.

Soon after Ryland shows up. "I have some questions for you. Where were you last night?"

Caeris "Flawless..."

She says she had some business in Goldenleaf. 

"They are going to be perfected"
become perfected in the genesis chamber. 
"Where is the genesis chamber?" We get directions

She worships Rovagug. Ryland knocks her out.

We need to go to Rylands neighbors basement.

We go to Crystal Cove.

We go to [[Eira Nightwhisper]]'s house. She has extra joints on her arm. Creepy...

She cuts her own throat and smiles with satisfaction. oh god...
