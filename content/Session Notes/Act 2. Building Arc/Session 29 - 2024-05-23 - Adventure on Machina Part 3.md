# Journal
## Erastus 10, 2348. Week 48. [[Macina]]

We're in the Dungeon in a basement of [[Orion Nightwhisper]].
It's where the imposters are coming from.

Damn, its another hole.

Its a small crawlspace about 10 feet. Looks like it was Disintegrated.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] leads followed by [[Ryland]], [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]], Myself, then [[Victor Kasune|Victor]]. We walk for more than an hour down this tunnel. We're heading away from the towns and closer towards the mines.

We find ourselves into a more traditional cave with mining equipment. There are several tunnels branching off this area. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] says the tunnels are dangerous at best, unstable at worst. Its a quartz mine.

There's words written on the walls in Aklo. They appear to be journal entries. [[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] reads it to us. There was a disaster. They are praying to Benorus. An angel imperial lord and guardian of goodly subterranean creatures.

BOOM! It explodes. The words were trapped and they exploded when read and caused a bit of a cave in. [[Ryland]] was trapped under the rubble. We get him out and heal him out and we leave the caves and bring him to his house.

We barter for potions and wands from [[Thorne Shadowsong]]. He overcharges. We head back down into the quartz mine.

I give [[Victor Kasune|Victor]] a pen and paper so he can draw a map of the tunnels. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] find a tunnel that he thinks is a good starting point.

We venture deeper and find ourselves in an area that's distinctively different. This area has stone tiles. This is a make shift living quarters. the furniture looks like someone smashed them over and over. 

There's no magic in here. There are about 30 rooms in here. We move on and **BOOM!** Another explosion. There was a burst of steam.

[[Orist Zinnorin|Orist]] tops us off with the cure wand.

We continue onward to what seems to be a massive storage space. There is disgusting stuff painted on the walls and ceiling in some foul smelling fluids with the occasional tuft of hair or bone or tooth to give it texture... Its religious in nature, It is some kind of praise to [[Rovagug]]. 

We continue on. We find a hinged door that's very mangled. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] opens it. There's a green dragon, it exhales acid on him. Aw crap.

It was just a trap. It was enlarged. asshole.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] deftly disables it. (nat 20)

Further is a triangular room. Inside is the genesis chamber. Something is wrong with it. The floor is covered in a viscous liquid. There's tubes going in and out of it.

The genesis chamber was theorized back in my time. it is an automated construct maker. this is really different from what I envisioned and that ominous chute doesn't look good.

I cast Enlarge Person on Sigmund. 

He walks into the room. SWARM! There's so many of them! Sigmund rips into them. They like to grapple. A lot. After fighting off hundreds of them, we emerge victorious.

Sigmund rips off part of the chute. Victor goes down to the bottom to where the genesis chamber lets the warforged out. 

Sigmund reminds us we still need to take care of whoever is in charge here.

Orist tried to claim the island. and Failed. The Machine glowed and stunned me. Can something be Anti-Divine? I scour my brain space and it comes up blank. I have no idea...

Orist says there's no deity, just the Genesis Chamber.

Orist is tapped. We should rest up and come back here tomorrow.

## Erastus 11, 2348. Week 48. [[Macina]]
We awake in the morning and go back to the genesis chamber.

The adjoining room is empty. nothing is in it. Only a carved message on the wall. Something edgy about not needing flesh and only rovagug will help.
