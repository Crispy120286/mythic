##### Housekeeping
- [x] Geoff, Can we drop the concept of people being far beneath our notice. I dont like the feeling that we're superior to everyone being forced on us. If we want to feel like that, we can choose to. I am not a fan of this one particular concept.

# Journal
## Gozran 30, 2348. Week 38, [[Thordun]]
### Combat Plan (Pre-session)
1. Open with Fireball. Spend 1 MP, CL 9. Spend 1 AP, +2 DC. Use the coin for Persist Spell. (Preferably don't do that. Don't want to be directly at fault of killing anyone.)
2. Spend 1 MP and cast Eagles Splendor on [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] for 9 minutes.
3. Cast Ashen Path 
4. Cast Fog Cloud.
5. Spend 1 MP to cast Mythic Haste for more attacks.
6. Wall of ice to divide enemies.

## Begin
Pre Buffing Time!

I cast:
Eagle Splendor on [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]].
Ashen Path on Party.
Haste on Party.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] Casts:
Long arm on himself.
Mirror Image on himself.

We get into combat!
One of the Bards leaves and calls for backup. we hear more drums.

Success! 

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] slays the [[Raz'gar Gugbane|Master of Blades]].

We take the body, magic items, and the loot from the room. 
Run away!

After a long while we finally are in an area where we can take a break.

[[Keeg]] cast cure moderate wounds. is he a cleric?

We open the chest and search through the loot. The chest is full of mithril items. Just mundane items and art objects.

| Loot                          | Description | Who took |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Mithril Full plate +1         |             |          |
| Mithril Heavy Steel Shield +1 |             |          |
| Cloak of Resistance +1        |             |          |
| Mithril Trident +2            |             |          |

The bags have some trophies of merit and a signet ring with rank.

We continue through tunnels for another solid hour before we find ourselves at a corridor.

Ashen Path again and Mythic Haste.

This encounter took almost everything out of me. I have burned through almost all of my spells.

There was 4 bugbear warriors in the room, a bard, a cleric, and the [[Grendok Mok'bara|Paralictor]].

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] was Dominated and ordered to "Kill the Wizard".
[[Voltaire]] protected me from his charge and he eventually broke free of the spell.


[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] deals the final blow and slays the [[Grendok Mok'bara|Paralictor]].

Then we feel it. The [[Stray Deity of War and Strategy]] is on the move... Oh shit. I'm tapped. We got to go.
