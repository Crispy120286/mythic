##### Housekeeping
- [ ] Notes
- [ ] ideas for island. I want something magical. I'm not a huge fan of puzzles but if I need to put together a magical thingy or some piece of ancient (my time) history or magic. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] got a cool keep and a ton of kobolds. I would like to find something but more on the lore or magical side. 

# Journal
## Desnus 2, 2348, Week 38
[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] is ready to start building on his island.
> [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] is now lvl 8
[[Voltaire]] says he is heading back to [[New Haven]].

I set sail to the island I wish to claim for myself. It takes us 3 weeks to get there.

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] arrives on [[New Haven]] and has the halflings build him a new warship.
[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] is having his warship search for new islands and people. He is unsuccessful.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] named his island [[Thordun]].

## Desnus 23, 2348, Week 41
We arrive on the island. We land in a medium sized glade.
[[Lysander Ravensong|Lysander]] rolls survival (28) and we hunt rabbits and forage for some food.

We spend a week surveying the island to get an accurate map of its layout.

## Desnus 24, 2348, Week 41
The survey is complete (Counts as taking 20). There are some natural springs. There are no shrines or signs of a local deity.

"I claim this island in the name of [[House Colorion]]. I name it [[Gnostis]]."
I cannot detect my [[Float Stones]]. Its buried underground... Its hidden. Somewhere in that gap is my [[Float Stones]].

I call upon the Mythics for help. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], [[Victor Kasune|Victor]], and [[Aurora]] respond to my call for help.

It takes everyone a week to show up.

I set my crew to digging the hole. I send my ship to find some elves and food and iron on one of the islands I found. Diggy Diggy hole.

## Sarenith 1, 2348, Week 42
Everyone arrives. [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] arrives first. [[Aurora]] arrives second.

She gives me a pill of Foxes Cunning.

[[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] goes to diggy diggy hole and rallies the miners.

[[Lysander Ravensong|Lysander]] lands and says the Elves didn't bite, they don't want to leave.

## To the door.
We find an opaque wall of force. All that can be seen is a shallow chamber beyond.
We breach it with mythic power and dispel magic.

Aurlia Arcane Academy of Abjuration.
[[Caitlin Colorion]] Memorial Evaluation Hex. My grandmother. I was here when it was being built. I was about 8 or 9 years old. My father left me in the care of my grandmother. I kind of remember Aurlia. She was friends with my grandmother.

I remember the workers  carving the names into the stone.

The door is protected by a cloudkill and fire lightning bolt.

I place my platinum coin in the hole. (sigh) My strings are being pulled.

Another short hallway.

This was for a hex of student (6 of them). 

Another door

The room open to a hexagonal room. Subtle energies in the room. There are 6 doors including the one I entered. First one is Practical Magic. Second is Research Lab. third door is Graduation Pavilion, under the portrait of [[Caitlin Colorion|Caitlin]]. The other doors Crafting facilities, and Examination Hall.

The Colorions filter out after 50 or 60 years. 

We go into the first room. Practical Magic.

We decide for Combat.

I cast Mage Armor, [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]] casts Shield.

Iron Golem?! Oooh crap.
